      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, December 22nd 2022 Next.js 13.1 Posted by OJ Kwon @ _ojkwon Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Next.js 13.1 includes improvements to both the pages/ (stable) and app/ (beta) directories: app Directory (Beta) Improvements: Improved reliability and performance. Built-in Module Transpilation: Bringing next-transpile-modules capabilities into core. Edge Runtime (Stable): A light Node.js runtime for the Edge. Turbopack Updates: Support for Tailwind CSS, next/image , @next/font , and more. Middleware Improvements: Return responses and set request headers. SWC Import Resolution: For smaller JavaScript bundles when using barrel files. Memory usage improvements, new templates, and more! Update today by running: Terminal npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest Improved reliability and support for app directory In Next.js 13, we announced the new app directory (beta). This new routing and data fetching system can be incrementally adopted alongside your existing pages directory. The app directory provides many benefits, including enhanced layouts, co-location of components, tests, and styles, component-level data fetching, and more. Thanks to your feedback and early testing, we've made several improvements to the reliability of the app directory: No Layout Divs: Previously, the app directory added additional <div> elements to scroll layouts into view when navigating. With 13.1, these extra elements are no longer created. The scrolling behavior is preserved. TypeScript Plugin: We've built a new TypeScript plugin that provides suggestions for page and layout configuration options, brings documentation directly into your IDE, and provides helpful usage hints around Server and Client Components (such as preventing the use of useState in Server Components). Learn more . Reliability Improvements: We've patched numerous bugs, including improved CSS modules support, correctly de-duplicating cache() and fetch() for layouts and pages, memory leaks, and more. Less Client-Side JavaScript: The app directory now includes 9.3kB less client-side JavaScript than the pages directory. This baseline doesn't increase whether you add 1 or 1000 Server Components to your application. The React runtime is temporarily slightly larger, the increase is caused by the React Server Components runtime, which handles mechanics that Next.js previously handled. We are working to reduce this further. pages/ app/ delta Total First Load JS Baseline -9.3kB 12.1% smaller Next.js Runtime Baseline -12kB 56.8% smaller React Runtime Baseline +2.7kB 5.2% larger We're excited about continuing to make progress on the stability of the app directory. The beta documentation for the app directory has had hundreds of updates based on your feedback . Built-in module transpilation (stable) You can now mark dependencies from local packages (like monorepos) or from external dependencies ( node_modules ) to be transpiled and bundled. This built-in support replaces the popular next-transpile-modules package. /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */ const nextConfig = { transpilePackages : [ '@acme/ui' , 'lodash-es' ] , }; module . exports = nextConfig; We are thankful to Pierre de la Martini√®re\n( @martpie ) for their work on this package and their assistance in helping ensure the built-in support met the community's needs. Import resolution for smaller bundles Many popular npm packages make use of \"barrel files\" to provide a single file that re-exports other modules. For example: @acme/ui/index.ts export { default as Button } from './dist/Button' ; export { default as Slider } from './dist/Slider' ; export { default as Dropdown } from './dist/Dropdown' ; This allows consumers of the package to use named exports in a single line: import { Button , Slider , Dropdown } from '@acme/ui' ; While bundlers understand these barrel files and can remove unused re-exports (called \"dead code elimination\"), this process involves parsing/compiling all re-exported files. In case of published libraries some npm packages ship barrel files that have thousands of modules re-exported, which slows down compile times. These libraries recommended babel-plugin-transform-imports to avoid this issue, but for those using SWC, there was no previous support. We've added a new SWC transform built into Next.js called modularizeImports . This new setting enables the SWC transform which changes your import statements based on a defined pattern. For example, the above code for using three components would be automatically converted to use direct imports, without the developer needing to write this code manually: // Before (with barrel file) import { Button , Slider , Dropdown } from '@acme/ui' ; // After (with modularized imports from plugin) import Button from '@acme/ui/dist/Button' ; import Slider from '@acme/ui/dist/Slider' ; import Dropdown from '@acme/ui/dist/Dropdown' ; This transformation is possible with the modularizeImports option in next.config.js : next.config.js module . exports = { modularizeImports : { '@acme/ui' : { transform : '@acme/ui/dist/{{member}}' , } , } , }; Leveraging this transform with @mui/icons-material or lodash allows skipping compilation of unused files. Learn more . View a demo to see this in action. A light Node.js runtime for the edge, now stable for API routes The Edge Runtime inside Next.js uses a strict subset of Node.js APIs (like Request , Response , and more) which are compatible with Edge computing platforms like Vercel or when self-hosting. These APIs run everywhere, including in the browser, allowing developers to learn them once and write everywhere. pages/api/hello.ts // \"experimental-\" prefix is no longer needed export const config = { runtime : 'edge' , }; export default function handler (req : Request ) { return new Response ( 'Hello World' ); } Next.js Middleware already uses this light edge runtime by default for better performance. As Middleware can run before every request in your application, having a lightweight runtime is critical to ensure low latency. In Next.js 12.2, we added the ability to optionally use this runtime for API Routes as well. With 13.1, the Edge Runtime inside Next.js is now stable for API routes. When self-hosted, Middleware and API Routes using the Edge Runtime will run as a single-region workload by default as part of next start . On Vercel, Next.js Middleware and API Routes are deployed globally using Vercel Edge Functions for the lowest possible latency. Vercel Edge Functions are also now generally available . Turbopack improvements After releasing the Turbopack alpha with Next.js 13, we've been focused on improving reliability, adding support for the most requested features, and defining plans for plugins and usage in other frameworks. Since Next.js 13.0.0, Turbopack: Supports PostCSS, including Tailwind CSS Supports next/image Supports @next/font (Google Fonts) Supports loading CSS from dynamic import() statements Supports CSS source maps (thank you @ahabhgk for their contribution ) Improved error handling in next dev error overlay Improved memory usage Improved CSS modules support Improved chunking algorithm for HMR updates Improved reliability for HMR source maps We are thankful to Evan You and the Vite community for their feedback and contributions to ensure the Turbopack benchmarks are as accurate as possible. We've worked together with the Vite team to validate the latest Turbopack benchmarks and make numerous improvements to our testing methodology. As a result of this collaboration, we now use a more accurate metric which includes time spent in React's update mechanism. We were able to improve React Fast Refresh time by 30ms in Turbopack as well as Next.js 13.1 on webpack. We've also added a new benchmark for using Vite with SWC, which shows improved performance compared to using the default Vite with Babel. View the updated benchmarks or read about the testing methodology . Try out the Turbopack alpha version today in Next.js 13 with next dev --turbo . If you have any feedback let us know on the GitHub Discussion . Next.js advanced Middleware Thanks to your feedback, we're making Next.js Middleware more powerful than ever. With 13.1, you can now return responses from Middleware, as well as set headers on the request. These API improvements give you powerful new flexibility to customize every part of the Next.js routing lifecycle. The experimental.allowMiddlewareResponseBody configuration option inside next.config.js is no longer required. You can now more easily set headers on the request, as well as respond directly without having to rewrite or redirect : middleware.ts import { NextResponse } from 'next/server' ; export function middleware (request : Request ) { // Check if a user has access... if ( ! isAuthorized (request)) { return NextResponse .json ({ message : 'Unauthorized' }); } // Add a new header, this will change the incoming request headers // that you can read in getServerSideProps and API routes const requestHeaders = new Headers ( request .headers); requestHeaders .set ( 'x-version' , '13.1' ); return NextResponse .next ({ request : { // Apply new request headers headers : requestHeaders , } , }); } Learn more about Next.js advanced Middleware . Other improvements @next/font now supports adding multiple font weights and styles in the same font declaration. Learn more . next/dynamic now uses React primitives lazy() and <Suspense> . The previous suspense option is no longer required. With these changes, next/dynamic is now compatible with the app directory. create-next-app has been updated with a new design, now including @next/font by default for automatic self-hosting of fonts with zero layout shift. Try it out with npx create-next-app@latest or deploy the template . We've made numerous improvements to the App Directory Playground , which showcases some of the latest features and conventions of the app directory (beta) in Next.js 13. Deploy your own . We've created a high-performance image gallery template , which includes image placeholders, lazy loading, automatic optimization, keyboard support, and more. Deploy your own . We've created a resource for understanding how to migrate a large, open-source React and Express.js application to Next.js, including a detailed walkthrough and links back to specific commits.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Tuesday, September 19th 2023 Next.js 13.5 Posted by Jimmy Lai @ feedthejim Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Tobias Koppers @ wSokra Next.js 13.5 improves local dev performance and reliability with: 22% faster local server startup: Iterate faster with the App & Pages Router 29% faster HMR (Fast Refresh): For faster iterations when saving changes 40% less memory usage: Measured when running next start Optimized Package Imports: Faster updates when using popular icon and component libraries next/image Improvements: <picture> , art direction, and dark mode support And over 438 bugs patched! Upgrade today and register for Next.js Conf on Oct 26: npm i next@latest react@latest react - dom@latest eslint - config - next@latest Improving startup and Fast Refresh time We're excited to see the continued adoption of the App Router, now growing 80% MoM when looking at the top 10 million origins crawled by the HTTP Archive . Since Next.js 13.4, our focus has been on improving performance and reliability for App Router applications. Comparing 13.4 to 13.5, we've seen the following improvements on a new application: 22% faster local server startup 29% faster HMR (Fast Refresh) 40% less memory usage We were able to achieve this performance increase through optimizations like: Doing less work by caching or minimizing slow operations Optimizing expensive file system operations Better incremental tree traversal during compilation Moving unnecessary blocking synchronous calls to be lazy Automatically configuring large icon libraries Next.js user Lattice reported between 87-92% faster compilation in their testing. While we continue to iterate and improve our current bundler performance, we're also working on Turbopack (Beta) in parallel to further increase performance. With 13.5, next dev --turbo now supports more features. Optimized Package Imports We've made an exciting breakthrough to optimize package imports, improving both local dev performance and production cold starts, when using large icon or component libraries or other dependencies that re-export hundreds or thousands of modules. Previously, we added support for modularizeImports , enabling you to configure how imports should resolve when using these libraries. In 13.5, we have superseeded this option with optimizePackageImports , which doesn't require you to specify the mapping of imports, but instead will automatically optimize imports for you. Libraries like @mui/icons-material , @mui/material , date-fns , lodash , lodash-es , ramda , react-bootstrap , @headlessui/react , @heroicons/react , and lucide-react are now automatically optimized, only loading the modules you are actually using, while still giving you the convenience of writing import statements with many named exports. View the PR or learn more about optimizePackageImports in our documentation. next/image Improvements Based on community feedback, we've added a new experimental function unstable_getImgProps() to support advanced use cases without using the <Image> component directly, including: Working with background-image or image-set Working with canvas context.drawImage() or new Image() Working with <picture> media queries to implement Art Direction or Light/Dark Mode images import { unstable_getImgProps as getImgProps } from 'next/image' ; export default function Page () { const common = { alt : 'Hero' , width : 800 , height : 400 }; const { props: { srcSet: dark } , } = getImgProps ({ ... common , src : '/dark.png' }); const { props: { srcSet: light , ... rest } , } = getImgProps ({ ... common , src : '/light.png' }); return ( < picture > < source media = \"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcSet = {dark} /> < source media = \"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcSet = {light} /> < img { ... rest} /> </ picture > ); } Additionally, the placeholder prop now supports providing arbitrary data:image/ for placeholder images that shouldn't be blurred ( demo ). Learn more about next/image in our documentation. Other Improvements Since 13.4.0 , we've fixed over 438 bugs and made various improvements including: [Docs] New documentation on Forms and Mutations [Docs] New documentation on Server and Client Components [Docs] New documentation on Content Security Policy and Nonces [Docs] New documentation on Caching and Revalidating [Feature] useParams and useSearchParams from next/navigation now work in the Pages Router for incremental adoption [Feature] Support for scroll: false on router.push / router.replace [Feature] Support for scroll={false} on next/link [Feature] HTTPS support for development: next dev --experimental-https [Feature] Added support for cookies().has() ( Docs ) [Feature] Added support for IPv6 hostnames [Feature] Added support for Yarn PnP with the App Router [Feature] Added support for redirect() in Server Actions [Feature] Added support for using Bun with creating projects: bunx create-next-app ( Docs ) [Feature] Draft Mode support for use inside Middleware and the Edge Runtime [Feature] cookies() and headers() are now supported inside Middleware [Feature] Metadata API now supports summary_large_image in Twitter cards [Feature] RedirectType is now exported from next/navigation [Feature] Added experimental test mode for Playwright ( Docs ) [Improvement] Refactored next start to handle 1062% more requests/second [Improvement] Optimized Next.js internals to improve cold starts (up to 40% faster, tested on Vercel) [Improvement] Better Jest support for the App Router ( PR ) [Improvement] Redesigned next dev output ( PR ) [Improvement] Server Actions now work with fully static routes (including revalidating data with ISR) [Improvement] Server Actions no longer block navigation between routes [Improvement] Server Actions can no longer trigger multiple concurrent actions [Improvement] Server Actions calling redirect() now push into the history stack instead of replacing the current entry to ensure the back button works [Improvement] Server Actions add no-cache, no-store cache-control header to prevent browser caching [Improvement] Fixed a bug where Server Actions could be called twice after navigating [Improvement] Improved support for Emotion CSS with Server Components [Improvement] Support for scroll-behavior: smooth for hash url changes [Improvement] Added polyfill for Array.prototype.at in all browsers [Improvement] Fixed race condition in next dev cache when handling multiple parallel requests [Improvement] fetch output in console now shows requests that skipped cache with cache: SKIP [Improvement] usePathname now properly strips basePath [Improvement] next/image now properly preloads images in App Router [Improvement] not-found no longer renders the root layout twice [Improvement] NextRequest can now be cloned (i.e new NextRequest(request) ) [Improvement] app/children/page.tsx now properly works for literal /children routes [Improvement] Content Security Policy now supports nonce for preinitialized scripts [Improvement] Using redirect from next/navigation now supports basePath [Improvement] Fixed process.env not being available during rendering in output: 'standalone' mode [Improvement] Improved error message when using a Static Export with unsupported features [Improvement] Improved recursive readdir implementation (~3x faster) [Improvement] Fixed fallback: false with dynamic route segments previously causing hanging requests [Improvement] Fixed error where signal was passed to revalidate requests, causing them to fail when the request was already aborted [Improvement] Removed fetch polling on 404 page in favor of websocket events, preventing unnecessary reloads when running next dev [Improvement] performance.measure no longer can cause a hydration mismatch [Improvement] Fixed cases where an unexpected full reload could happen editing pages/_app [Improvement] ImageResponse now extends Response for improved type checking ( PR ) [Improvement] pages is no longer shown when there is no pages output in next build [Improvement] Fixed skipTrailingSlashRedirect being ignored in <Link> [Improvement] Fixed duplicated dynamic metadata routes in dev mode Contributors Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 2,800 individual developers, industry partners like Google and Meta, and our core team at Vercel.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Wednesday, August 11th 2021 Next.js 11.1 Posted by DongYoon Kang @ kdy1dev Jiachi Liu @ huozhi JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Maia Teegarden @ padmaia Shu Ding @ shuding_ Steven @ styfle Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Tobias Koppers @ wSokra We're improving build performance across the entire stack with Next.js 11.1, featuring: Security Patch : An important update to prevent potential open redirects. ES Modules Support : Enable today with an experimental flag. Rust-based Tooling : SWC integration to replace JS tooling (Babel and Terser). Faster Data Fetching : 2x faster data fetching with HTTP keep-alive when pre-rendering. Faster Source Maps : 70% faster builds and 67% less memory usage when using source maps. ESLint Integration Improvements : More accessible defaults and linting for typos. next/image Improvements : Optional Sharp usage, better support for next export . Update today by running npm i next@latest . Security Patch The Next.js team works with security researchers and auditors to prevent against vulnerabilities. We are thankful to Gabriel Benmergui from Robinhood for their investigation and discovery of an open redirect with pages/_error.js and subsequent responsible disclosure. The reported issue did not directly harm users, but it could allow for phishing attacks by redirecting to an attacker's domain from a trusted domain. We've landed a patch in Next.js 11.1 preventing this open redirect from occurring, as well as security regression tests . For more details, please read the public CVE . We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Next.js to improve the overall security of your application. For future responsible disclosure of reports, email us at security@vercel.com . Note: Next.js applications hosted on Vercel are not affected by this vulnerability (and, therefore, no action is needed for your Next.js apps running on Vercel. ES Modules Support We're working on extensive ES Modules support in Next.js, both as input modules and as an output target. Starting with Next.js 11.1, you can now import npm packages using ES Modules (e.g. \"type\": \"module\" in their package.json ) with an experimental flag. next.config.js module . exports = { // Prefer loading of ES Modules over CommonJS experimental : { esmExternals : true } , }; ES Modules support includes backward compatibility to support the previous import behavior of CommonJS . In Next.js 12, esmExternals: true will become the default. We recommend trying the new option and leave feedback GitHub Discussions if you have suggestions for improvement. Adopting Rust-based SWC We're working on integrating SWC , a super-fast JavaScript and TypeScript compiler written in Rust, that will replace two toolchains used in Next.js: Babel for individual files and Terser for minifying of output bundles. As part of replacing Babel with SWC, we are porting all custom code transformations Next.js uses to SWC transforms written in Rust to maximize performance. For example, tree shaking unused code inside getStaticProps , getStaticPaths , and getServerSideProps . As part of replacing Terser, we are working on ensuring the SWC minifier has similar output to Terser while massively improving performance and parallelization of minification. In early tests, previous code transformations using Babel dropped from ~500ms to ~10ms and code minification from Terser dropped from ~250ms to ~30ms using SWC. Overall, this resulted in twice as fast builds . We're excited to announce DongYoon Kang , the creator of SWC , and Maia Teegarden , contributor to Parcel , have joined the Next.js team at Vercel to work on improving both next dev and next build performance. We will be sharing more results from our SWC adoption in the next release when it's made stable. Improved Performance Builds & Data Fetching When using next build and making numerous HTTP requests, we've improved performance by ~2x on average. For example, if you're using getStaticProps and getStaticPaths to fetch content from a Headless CMS, you should see noticeably faster builds. Next.js automatically polyfills node-fetch and now enables HTTP Keep-Alive by default. According to external benchmarks , this should make pre-rendering ~2x faster . To disable HTTP Keep-Alive for certain fetch() calls, you can add the agent option: import { Agent } from 'https' ; const url = '<https://example.com>' ; const agent = new Agent ({ keepAlive : false }); fetch (url , { agent }); To override all fetch() calls globally, you can use next.config.js : next.config.js module . exports = { httpAgentOptions : { keepAlive : false , } , }; Source Maps Including browser source maps in Next.js applications now has about 70% less performance cost and about 67% less memory cost due to optimizations in webpack asset and source map processing. This only affects Next.js applications with productionBrowserSourceMaps: true in their next.config.js file. With Next.js 11.1, build times are only increased by 11% when source maps are enabled. We've also worked with Sentry to increase performance of uploading source maps with the Sentry Next.js plugin . ESLint Improvements In Next.js 11, we introduced built-in ESLint support through next lint . Since its initial release, we've continued adding rules that help developers fix common mistakes in their applications. Default Accessibility Rules Better accessibility rules are now included by default, preventing issues with ARIA properties that do not match each other and usage of non-existent ARIA attributes. These rules will warn by default. aria-props aria-proptypes aria-unsupported-elements role-has-required-aria-props role-supports-aria-props Special thanks to community contributor JeffersonBledsoe for adding these rules. Common Typos Linting for common typos in getStaticProps , getStaticPaths , and getServerSideProps will now warn by default. This will help with cases where a small typo causes data fetching to not be called. For example getstaticprops or getStaticprops will show a warning. Special thanks to community contributor kaykdm for creating this rule. next/image Improvements We've been collecting community feedback about next/image and the built-in Image Optimization and are excited to share multiple improvements to performance, developer experience, and user experience. Image Optimization By default, Next.js uses WebAssembly to perform Image Optimization, which offsets the install time of the Next.js package by being significantly smaller and not having a post-install step. With Next.js 11.1, you can optionally install sharp which optimizes for uncached image generation time with a trade-off of slower installation. The WebAssembly-based image optimizer has been updated to support ARM chips like Apple M1 with Node.js 16. The built-in image optimizer now automatically detects the external image content type based on the content of the response body. This allows Next.js to optimize images hosted on AWS S3 when the response header is Content-Type: application/octet-stream . Lazy Generation of Blur Up Placeholders in Development During next dev static image imports with placeholder=\"blur\" are now automatically lazy-generated, improving dev server startup time for applications with many static image imports: pages/index.js import Image from 'next/image' ; import author from '../public/me.png' ; export default function Home () { return ( // The placeholder for this image is lazy-generated during development < Image src = {author} alt = \"Picture of the author\" placeholder = \"blur\" /> ); } Other Image Improvements Images which have been previously loaded are no longer lazy-loaded : When an image has been loaded on a page before, either through client navigation or loading it at another point in the page, Next.js will now automatically skip the lazy loading to avoid a quick flash before showing the image. Support for custom image loaders with next export : next/image now supports using next export along with any third-party image optimization service . You can configure images.loader: \"custom\" in next.config.js when you intend to provide the custom loader prop to next/image . New event for when images complete loading: Based on user feedback, we‚Äôve added a new property onLoadingComplete to next/image . This allows for registering a callback that is invoked once the image has fully loaded. Configuration for default image cache TTL (Time to Live): You can now configure images.minimumCacheTTL in next.config.js to change the default cache TTL for optimized images. When possible, we recommend using static image import s , as those automatically use the maximum TTL because the image content hash is in the URL. Community Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 1,700 individual developers, industry partners like Google and Facebook, and our core team. We're proud to see that community continue to grow. Within the last six months alone, we've seen a 50% increase in Next.js downloads on NPM, from 4.1M to 6.2M and the number of homepages using Next.js in the Alexa top 10,000 has grown 50%.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, October 26th 2023 Next.js 14 Posted by Lee Robinson @ leeerob Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens As we announced at Next.js Conf , Next.js 14 is our most focused release with: Turbopack : 5,000 tests passing for App & Pages Router 53% faster local server startup 94% faster code updates with Fast Refresh Server Actions (Stable) : Progressively enhanced mutations Integrated with caching & revalidating Simple function calls, or works natively with forms Partial Prerendering (Preview) : Fast initial static response + streaming dynamic content Next.js Learn (New) : Free course teaching the App Router, authentication, databases, and more. Upgrade today or get started with: Terminal npx create-next-app@latest Next.js Compiler: Turbocharged Since Next.js 13, we've been working to improve local development performance in Next.js in both the Pages and App Router. Previously, we were rewriting next dev and other parts of Next.js to support this effort. We have since changed our approach to be more incremental. This means our Rust-based compiler will reach stability soon, as we've refocused on supporting all Next.js features first. 5,000 integration tests for next dev are now passing with Turbopack , our underlying Rust engine. These tests include 7 years of bug fixes and reproductions. While testing on vercel.com , a large Next.js application, we've seen: Up to 53.3% faster local server startup Up to 94.7% faster code updates with Fast Refresh This benchmark is a practical result of performance improvements you should expect with a large application (and large module graph). With 90% of tests for next dev now passing, you should see faster and more reliable performance consistently when using next dev --turbo . Once we hit 100% of tests passing, we'll move Turbopack to stable in an upcoming minor release. We'll also continue to support using webpack for custom configurations and ecosystem plugins. You can follow the percentage of tests passing at areweturboyet.com . Forms and Mutations Next.js 9 introduced API Routes‚Äîa way to quickly build backend endpoints alongside your frontend code. For example, you would create a new file in the api/ directory: pages/api/submit.ts import type { NextApiRequest , NextApiResponse } from 'next' ; export default async function handler ( req : NextApiRequest , res : NextApiResponse , ) { const data = req .body; const id = await createItem (data); res .status ( 200 ) .json ({ id }); } Then, on the client-side, you could use React and an event handler like onSubmit to make a fetch to your API Route. pages/index.tsx import { FormEvent } from 'react' ; export default function Page () { async function onSubmit (event : FormEvent < HTMLFormElement >) { event .preventDefault (); const formData = new FormData ( event .currentTarget); const response = await fetch ( '/api/submit' , { method : 'POST' , body : formData , }); // Handle response if necessary const data = await response .json (); // ... } return ( < form onSubmit = {onSubmit}> < input type = \"text\" name = \"name\" /> < button type = \"submit\" >Submit</ button > </ form > ); } Now with Next.js 14, we want to simplify the developer experience of authoring data mutations. Further, we want to improve the user experience when the user has a slow network connection, or when submitting a form from a lower-powered device. Server Actions (Stable) What if you didn't need to manually create an API Route? Instead, you could define a function that runs securely on the server, called directly from your React components. The App Router is built on the React canary channel, which is stable for frameworks to adopt new features. As of v14, Next.js has upgraded to the latest React canary , which includes stable Server Actions. The previous example from the Pages Router can be simplified to one file: app/page.tsx export default function Page () { async function create (formData : FormData ) { 'use server' ; const id = await createItem (formData); } return ( < form action = {create}> < input type = \"text\" name = \"name\" /> < button type = \"submit\" >Submit</ button > </ form > ); } Server Actions should feel familiar for any developers who have previously used server-centric frameworks in the past. It's built on web fundamentals like forms and the FormData Web API . While using Server Actions through a form is helpful for progressive enhancement, it is not a requirement. You can also call them directly as a function, without a form. When using TypeScript, this gives you full end-to-end type-safety between the client and server. Mutating data, re-rendering the page, or redirecting can happen in one network roundtrip , ensuring the correct data is displayed on the client, even if the upstream provider is slow. Further, you can compose and reuse different actions, including many different actions in the same route. Caching, Revalidating, Redirecting, and more Server Actions are deeply integrated into the entire App Router model. You can: Revalidate cached data with revalidatePath() or revalidateTag() Redirect to different routes through redirect() Set and read cookies through cookies() Handle optimistic UI updates with useOptimistic() Catch and display errors from the server with useFormState() Display loading states on the client with useFormStatus() Learn more about Forms and Mutations with Server Actions or about the security model and best practices for Server Components and Server Actions. Partial Prerendering (Preview) We'd like to share a preview of Partial Prerendering ‚Äî a compiler optimization for dynamic content with a fast initial static response ‚Äî that we're working on for Next.js. Partial Prerendering builds on a decade of research and development into server-side rendering (SSR), static-site generation (SSG), and incremental static revalidation (ISR). Motivation We've heard your feedback. There's currently too many runtimes, configuration options, and rendering methods to have to consider. You want the speed and reliability of static, while also supporting fully dynamic, personalized responses. Having great performance globally and personalization shouldn't come at the cost of complexity. Our challenge was to create a better developer experience, simplifying the existing model without introducing new APIs for developers to learn. While partial caching of server-side content has existed, these approaches still need to meet the developer experience and composability goals we aim for. Partial Prerendering requires no new APIs to learn. Built on React Suspense Partial Prerendering is defined by your Suspense boundaries. Here's how it works. Consider the following ecommerce page: app/page.tsx export default function Page () { return ( < main > < header > < h1 >My Store</ h1 > < Suspense fallback = {< CartSkeleton />}> < ShoppingCart /> </ Suspense > </ header > < Banner /> < Suspense fallback = {< ProductListSkeleton />}> < Recommendations /> </ Suspense > < NewProducts /> </ main > ); } With Partial Prerendering enabled, this page generates a static shell based on your <Suspense /> boundaries. The fallback from React Suspense is prerendered. Suspense fallbacks in the shell are then replaced with dynamic components, like reading cookies to determine the cart, or showing a banner based on the user. When a request is made, the static HTML shell is immediately served: < main > < header > < h1 >My Store</ h1 > < div class = \"cart-skeleton\" > <!-- Hole --> </ div > </ header > < div class = \"banner\" /> < div class = \"product-list-skeleton\" > <!-- Hole --> </ div > < section class = \"new-products\" /> </ main > Since <ShoppingCart /> reads from cookies to look at the user session, this component is then streamed in as part of the same HTTP request as the static shell. There are no extra network roundtrips needed. app/cart.tsx import { cookies } from 'next/headers' export default function ShoppingCart () { const cookieStore = cookies () const session = cookieStore .get ( 'session' ) return ... } To have the most granular static shell, this may require adding additional Suspense boundaries. However, if you're already using loading.js today, this is an implicit Suspense boundary, so no changes would be required to generate the static shell. Coming soon Partial prerendering is under active development. We'll be sharing more updates in an upcoming minor release. Metadata Improvements Before your page content can be streamed from the server, there's important metadata about the viewport, color scheme, and theme that need to be sent to the browser first. Ensuring these meta tags are sent with the initial page content helps a smooth user experience, preventing the page from flickering by changing the theme color, or shifting layout due to viewport changes. In Next.js 14, we've decoupled blocking and non-blocking metadata. Only a small subset of metadata options are blocking, and we want to ensure non-blocking metadata will not prevent a partially prerendered page from serving the static shell. The following metadata options are now deprecated and will be removed from metadata in a future major version: viewport : Sets the initial zoom and other properties of the viewport colorScheme : Sets the support modes (light/dark) for the viewport themeColor : Sets the color the chrome around the viewport should render with Starting with Next.js 14, there are new options viewport and generateViewport to replace these options. All other metadata options remain the same. You can start adopting these new APIs today. The existing metadata options will continue to work.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Tuesday, October 27th 2020 Next.js 10 Posted by Bel√©n Curcio @ okbel Connor Davis @ connordav_is JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Joe Haddad @ timer150 Luis Alvarez @ luis_fades Shu Uesugi @ chibicode Steven @ styfle Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens We are excited to introduce Next.js 10, featuring: Built-in Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization : Automatically optimize images using the new next/image component Internationalized Routing : Start internationalizing your Next.js applications with built-in primitives Next.js Analytics : Measure and act on real user performance Next.js Commerce : An all-in-one starter kit for high-performance e-commerce sites React 17 Support : The latest React release is fully compatible with Next.js getStaticProps / getServerSideProps Fast Refresh : Automatic reloading of properties when editing data fetching methods Fast Refresh for MDX : When using @next/mdx , Fast Refresh is now leveraged to apply changes without full page reloads Importing CSS from Third Party React Components : Importing CSS needed for components from npm is now supported Automatic Resolving of href : The as property is no longer needed on next/link @next/codemod CLI : Allows for easier access to all Next.js codemods Blocking Fallback for getStaticPaths : Wait on pre-rendering when generating new static pages instead of serving a static fallback page Built-in Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization Our goal with Next.js is to improve two things: Developer Experience and User Experience. This year we've already invested heavily in both Developer Experience and improving performance for all Next.js applications. We focused on reducing the amount of JavaScript the browser has to load. We introduced over 20 new features that improve performance and developer experience. At the same time, the JavaScript size of the Next.js core has been reduced by 16% . In January, we introduced a new best-in-class JavaScript code-splitting strategy in collaboration with the Google Chrome team. For example, Barnebys saw a 23% decrease in application size , and Sumup had a 70% decrease in their largest Javascript bundle size . These improvements were achieved without changing any code in their Next.js applications. Companies adopted this new strategy automatically by simply upgrading Next.js to the latest version. Images on the Web While our focus on reducing the amount of JavaScript the browser has to load has paid off, the web is not only Javascript: it's also markup and images. Images take up 50% of the total bytes on web pages. Images have a big impact on Largest Contentful Paint as they're often the largest visible element when a page is loaded. Largest Contentful Paint is a Core Web Vital that Google will be using in their search ranking very soon . Half of all images are over one megabyte in size, which means they aren't optimized to be displayed on the web. Nowadays users browse the web using their phones, tablets, and laptops, yet images are still as a one size fits all. For example: sites load a 2000 by 2000 pixel image, but phones are only displaying it as 100 by 100 pixels. Furthermore, 30% of images on web pages are outside of the initial viewport, meaning the browser loads images that a user does not see until they scroll further down the page. Images often don't have a width and height property, causing them to jump around when the page is loaded. This hurts the Cumulative Layout Shift Core Web Vital. 99.7% of images on websites don't use modern image formats like WebP. In order to use images on web pages in a performant way a lot of aspects have to be considered: size, weight, lazy loading, and modern image formats. Developers have to set up complicated build tooling to optimize images, however those tools usually don't cover user-submitted images coming from an external data source, making it impossible to optimize all images. This impossible development task inevitably leads to a frustrating end-user experience. Next.js Image Component We're excited to announce our solution to performant images on the web: the Next.js Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization. At it's most basic the Next.js Image Component is just a drop-in replacement for the HTML <img> element, evolved for the modern web. < img src = \"/profile-picture.jpg\" width = \"400\" height = \"400\" alt = \"Profile Picture\" /> import Image from 'next/image' ; < Image src = \"/profile-picture.jpg\" width = \"400\" height = \"400\" alt = \"Profile Picture\" />; The Google Chrome team helped create this React Component to improve page performance by making best practices the default. When using the next/image component, images are automatically lazy-loaded, meaning they're only rendered when the user is close to seeing the image. This prevents loading that 30% of images outside of the initial viewport. Image dimensions are enforced, allowing browsers to immediately render the space needed for the image instead of having it jump in when loaded, preventing layout shift. While width and height on the HTML <img> element can cause issues with responsive layouts, this is not the case when using next/image . When using next/image the image is automatically made responsive based on the aspect ratio from the provided width and height . Developers can mark images that are in the initial viewport, allowing Next.js to automatically preload these images. Preloading images in the initial viewport has shown improvements to the Largest Contentful Paint by up to 50%. Automatic Image Optimization Even with these improvements compared to the HTML <img> element, there's still a major problem. The 2000 by 2000 pixel image is sent to phones that render a smaller image. With Next.js 10 we're also solving that problem. The next/image component will automatically generate smaller sizes through built-in Image Optimization. Built-in Image Optimization automatically serves the images in modern image formats like WebP, which is about 30% smaller than JPEG, if the browser supports it. It also allows Next.js to automatically adopt future image formats and serve them to browsers that support those formats. Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if images come from an external data source, like a CMS, they are optimized. Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js 10 optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images. Conclusion The new next/image component and Automatic Image Optimization are powerful new primitives that will massively improve user experience. The next/image component handles automatic lazy-loading, preloading of critical images, correct sizing across devices, and automatically supports modern formats. These features work with images from any source. We are looking forward to seeing how much faster your user experience becomes with these new primites. For more details check out the Next.js Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization documentation . Internationalized Routing This year, several businesses and community members helped our team understand how important internationalization is. For example, we learned that 72% of consumers are more likely to stay on your site if it's been translated and 55% of consumers said they only buy from e-commerce sites in their native language. If you plan to go to market in a different country, internationalizing your project is critical for success. Internationalizing a project has two main pillars: Translations and Routing. Many React libraries prepare applications to be translated, but most of them expect you to handle routing manually, and generally only work with one rendering strategy. That's why, as part of Next.js 10, we're releasing built-in support for internationalized routing and language detection. This built-in support for internationalized routing supports Next.js' hybrid strategy, so you can choose between Static Generation or Server-Rendering on a per-page basis. Next.js 10 supports the two most common routing strategies: subpath routing and domain routing. For both strategies, you start by configuring the locales in the Next.js configuration. next.config.js module . exports = { i18n : { locales : [ 'en' , 'nl' ] , defaultLocale : 'en' , } , }; Locales are UTS Locale Identifiers , a standardized format for defining locales. Generally a Locale Identifier is made up of a language, region, and script separated by a dash: language-region-script . The region and script are optional. An example: en-US - English as spoken in the United States nl-NL - Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands nl - Dutch, no specific region Once your locales are configured you can choose subpath or domain routing. Subpath routing Subpath routing puts the locale in the url. This allows all languages to live on a single domain. For example, you can insert the locale in the url like /nl-nl/blog and /en/blog . Domain routing Domain routing enables you to map a locale to a top level domain. For example example.nl can be mapped to the nl locale and example.com can be mapped to the en locale. Domain routing requires some extra configuration to know how to route domains: next.config.js module . exports = { i18n : { locales : [ 'en' , 'nl' ] , domains : [ { domain : 'example.com' , defaultLocale : 'en' , } , { domain : 'example.nl' , defaultLocale : 'nl' , } , ] , } , }; Language Detection Next.js 10 has built-in language detection on the / route based on the Accept-Language header, which all modern browsers support. The configured locales will be matches against the Accept-Language header and then redirect according to the configured strategy. Search Engine Optimization Since Next.js knows the language of the page visited by the user, it will automatically add the lang attribute to the <html> tag. Next.js doesn't know about variants of a page so it's up to you to add the hreflang meta tags using next/head . You can learn more about hreflang in the Google Webmasters documentation . The future of internationalization in Next.js Internationalized Routing is the first in a series of features that will make internationalizing and localizing your project easier. Internationalized Routing allows for integrating with the majority of React internationalization libraries.

Your visitors have grown increasingly sensitive to site performance. More than 50% of them will abandon your website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load . If you're in e-commerce, many have found that improving your load time by 1/10th of a second resulted in a 1% increase in conversion . Because of how critical performance is to your success, we're proud to release Next.js Speed Insights. The solution for tracking real-world performance metrics and feeding those insights back into your development workflow. With Next.js Speed Insights: Instead of measuring once, you will now measure continuously. Instead of measuring on your development device, measurements will come from the actual devices that your visitors are using. Next.js Speed Insights is about focusing on the entire picture, deeply understanding your audience, and how your application performs for your users. We're so adamant about collecting real data because the causes of poor performance aren't always the most obvious. Performance regressions can result from a variety of places‚Äî third-party scripts and stylesheets, or first-party fonts, images, and videos that are oversized or slow. Core Web Vitals Google, in conjunction with the Web Performance Working Group , have established the set of metrics to accurately measure how users experience the performance of your website: aptly named, Web Vitals. Web Vitals are metrics that track the perceived loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability of your website‚Äîall three essential for website's overall health! Perceived loading speed can be measured by Largest Contentful Paint, or when all the page's content has been displayed. For example, when I open a link to buy a pair sneakers‚Äîthe amount of time that passes before I see my sneakers, their price, and the add to cart button is LCP. Page responsiveness can be measured by First Input Delay, which measures how long your users must wait to see the reaction of their first interaction with the page. For example, the amount of time between me clicking Add to Cart and the number of items in my cart incrementing is FID. Finally, visual stability can be measured by Cumulative Layout Shift, or how much elements move after being displayed to the user. For example, we've all experienced the frustration of trying to tap a button that moved because an image loaded late‚Äîthat's layout shift. The continuous measurement and conformance around these Web Vitals for your real users is crucial. It's the only way to truly know how your site performs for your users. The performance of your site can vary dramatically based on a user's device and their network conditions, or how they're interacting with the page. Sites that load personalized content or ads may also experience wildly different performance from user to user. An emulated test cannot capture these important signals. Next.js Speed Insights allows you to capture real-world insights, instead of synthetic benchmarks. It enables a continuous stream of measurement instead of relying on occasional testing, ensuring it's part of your developer workflow.

The new Next.js 10 features are powerful new tools for ecommerce. That's why today, in collaboration with BigCommerce, we released Next.js Commerce, the all-in-one React starter kit for ecommerce sites. With a few clicks, Next.js developers can clone, deploy, and fully customize it. Start right now at nextjs.org/commerce. React 17 Support React 17 had no breaking changes for Next.js, however there were some maintenance changes required, for example updating the peer dependencies. The new JSX transform is automatically enabled when React 17 is used, no configuration changes are needed. All you have to do to start using React 17 is upgrade Next.js and React: Terminal npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest getStaticProps / getServerSideProps Fast Refresh When making edits to your getStaticProps and getServerSideProps functions Next.js will now automatically re-run the function and apply the new data. This allows you to iterate quicker without having to refresh the page. To learn more about getStaticProps and getServerSideProps you can read the Data Fetching documentation . Fast Refresh for MDX When using Next.js with MDX through @next/mdx changing the MDX contents will now leverage Fast Refresh, making sure the browser does not have to reload the page on edits. The @next/mdx documentation guides you through how to set up MDX with Next.js. Importing CSS from Third Party React Components You can now import third party css inside of React components. This allows for code-splitting CSS only meant for a single component. For example you can now use the react-datepicker library without needing to import the CSS in _app.js : components/MyComponent.js import DatePicker from 'react-datepicker' ; import 'react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css' ; function MyComponent () {} You can refer to the built-in CSS support documentation to learn more about how Next.js handles CSS imports. Automatic Resolving of href If you've used dynamic routes before, you've probably ran into a case before where you had to provide both a href and as property to next/link . It would look something like this: < Link href = \"/categories/[slug]\" as = \"/categories/books\" /> This allowed Next.js to interpolate the href for the dynamic parameters, however, it caused friction when developers forgot to add the as or added the as in href causing the page transitions to not use client-side routing. We set out to solve this friction for developers a few months ago, with the main goal to improve developer experience and end user experience. We incrementally worked towards a solution that allows for href to be automatically resolved. We're excited to announce that as part of Next.js 10 you no longer have to use the as property for the majority of use-cases. Removing friction from developers and improving the end user experience. This change is fully backwards compatible, if you currently use both href and as the existing behavior is preserved. In order to adopt the automatic href resolving all you have to do is change your usage of next/link to only use href holding the value that you previously had in as property. < Link href = \"/categories/books\" /> To learn more about next/link and client-side routing you can refer to the next/link documentation . @next/codemod CLI We're committed to making sure Next.js upgrades are as smooth as possible through extensive backwards compatibility. This commitment starts with very sparingly deprecating features while introducing new and better solutions in their place. On top of this commitment we have extensive integration tests for all Next.js features, including tests that replicate local development. When a feature in Next.js is deprecate and requires large codebase changes our team creates a codemod for it. A codemod is an automated code transformation that you can run over your project to update source code. For example: We released a codemod for updating arrow functions and anonymous functions to named functions. This transformation is needed because otherwise React Fast Refresh does not detect the function as being a valid React Component. Similarly the React hooks eslint rules would not pick up the function as a React component. With Next.js 10 we're releasing a new Next.js codemods CLI tool that allows you run a single command to update your application: npx @next/codemod <transform> <path> . To learn more about the codemods you can check the Next.js Codemods documentation . Blocking Fallback for getStaticPaths In Next.js 9.3 we introduced getStaticProps and getStaticPaths along with the ability to return a fallback property in getStaticPaths . The fallback property allows for generating additional static pages without needing a full rebuild, serving a static HTML file initially that is then replaced by the fully rendered content on subsequent requests. The past few months we've received a lot of feedback from companies that wanted a similar but slightly different behavior: a blocking pre-render when a user requests the page for the first time. After that initial render the page would be re-used for subsequent requests. With Next.js 10 we're solving this case. We're excited to announce the new fallback: 'blocking' mode for getStaticPaths that enables the blocking behavior where no static fallback is sent to the browser. Instead the initial request is waited on for pre-rendering. pages/posts/[id].js export function getStaticPaths () { return { // enables blocking mode for the fallback behavior fallback : 'blocking' , }; } To learn more about fallback behavior for incrementally generating additional static pages you can refer to the fallback documentation . Redirect and notFound Support for getStaticProps / getServerSideProps Since the introduction of getStaticProps and getServerSideProps we have noticed cases where users are needing to return redirects and 404 responses. To help streamline these cases we now allow returning two new fields from getStaticProps and getServerSideProps : notFound and redirect . notFound Support When returning the notFound field with true the default 404 page will be returned with a status code of 404 . This allows you to avoid generating additional pages with SSG and having to handle rendering the 404 page manually. pages/posts/[id].js export function getStaticProps () { return { // returns the default 404 page with a status code of 404 notFound : true , }; } redirect Support Redirects can now be returned which contains the destination and whether the redirect should be permanent or not e.g. permanent: true . An optional statusCode can also be returned in place of the permanent field for cases where you need to use a specific status over the defaults. pages/posts/[id].js export function getStaticProps () { return { // returns a redirect to an internal page `/another-page` redirect : { destination : '/another-page' , permanent : false , } , }; } pages/posts/[id].js export function getServerSideProps () { return { // returns a redirect to an external domain `example.com` redirect : { destination : 'https://example.com' , permanent : false , } , }; } Conclusion We're excited to see the continued growth in Next.js adoption: We have had over 1,300 independent contributors, with over 120 new contributors since the 9.5 release On GitHub, the project has been starred over 54,800 times. Join the Next.js community on GitHub Discussions. Discussions is a community space that allows you to connect with other Next.js users and freely ask questions or share your work.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, May 4th 2023 Next.js 13.4 Posted by Sebastian Markb√•ge @ sebmarkbage Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Next.js 13.4 is a foundational release, marking stability for the App Router: App Router (Stable) : React Server Components Nested Routes & Layouts Simplified Data Fetching Streaming & Suspense Built-in SEO Support Turbopack (Beta) : Your local dev server, faster and with improved stability Server Actions (Alpha) : Mutate data on the server with zero client JavaScript Since the release of Next.js 13 six months ago, we've been focused on building the foundations for the future of Next.js‚ÄîApp Router‚Äîin a way that can be incrementally adopted without unnecessary breaking changes. Today, with the release of 13.4, you can now start adopting the App Router for production. Terminal npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest Next.js App Router We released Next.js in 2016 to provide an easy way to server-render React applications, with our goal to create a more dynamic, personalized, and global web. In the original announcement post , we shared some design principles of Next.js: Zero setup. Use the filesystem as an API Only JavaScript. Everything is a function Automatic server rendering and code splitting Data fetching is up to the developer Next.js is now six years old. Our original design principles have remained‚Äîand as Next.js has been adopted by more developers and companies, we have been working on a foundational upgrade to the framework to better achieve these principles. We've been working on the next generation of Next.js, and today with 13.4 , this next generation is stable and ready for adoption. This post will share more about our design decisions and choices for the App Router. Zero setup. Use the filesystem as an API File-system based routing has been a core feature of Next.js. In our original post, we showed this example of creating a route from a single React component: pages/about.js // Pages Router import React from 'react' ; export default () => < h1 >About us</ h1 >; There was nothing additional to configure. Drop a file inside pages/ and the Next.js router would take care of the rest. We still love this simplicity with routing. But as usage of the framework grew, so have the types of interfaces developers are looking to build with it. Developers have asked for improved support for defining layouts, nesting pieces of UI as layouts, and having more flexibility over defining loading and error states. This wasn't an easy thing to retrofit into the existing Next.js router. Every part of the framework has to be designed around the router. Page transitions, data fetching, caching, mutating and revalidating data, streaming, styling content, and more. To make our router compatible with streaming, and to solve these requests for enhanced support for layouts, we set out to build a new version of our router. This is where we landed after our initial release of our Layouts RFC . app/layout.js // New: App Router ‚ú® export default function RootLayout ({ children }) { return ( < html lang = \"en\" > < body >{children}</ body > </ html > ); } app/page.js export default function Page () { return < h1 >Hello, Next.js!</ h1 >; } What's more important than what you see here is what you don't see. This new router (which can be incrementally adopted through the app/ directory) has an entirely different architecture, built on the foundation of React Server Components and Suspense . This foundation has allowed us to remove Next.js specific APIs that were initially developed to extend the React primitives. For example, you no longer have to use a custom _app file to customize the global shared layout: pages/_app.js // Pages Router // This \"global layout\" wraps all routes. There's no way to // compose other layout components, and you cannot fetch global // data from this file. export default function MyApp ({ Component , pageProps }) { return < Component { ... pageProps} />; } With the Pages Router, layouts were not able to be composed, and data fetching could not be colocated with the component. With the new App Router, this is now supported. app/layout.js // New: App Router ‚ú® // The root layout is shared for the entire application export default function RootLayout ({ children }) { return ( < html lang = \"en\" > < body >{children}</ body > </ html > ); } app/dashboard/layout.js // Layouts can be nested and composed export default function DashboardLayout ({ children }) { return ( < section > < h1 >Dashboard</ h1 > {children} </ section > ); } With the Pages Router, _document was used to customize the initial payload from the server. pages/_document.js // Pages Router // This file allows you to customize the <html> and <body> tags // for the server request, but adds framework-specific features // rather than writing HTML elements. import { Html , Head , Main , NextScript } from 'next/document' ; export default function Document () { return ( < Html > < Head /> < body > < Main /> < NextScript /> </ body > </ Html > ); } With the App Router, you no longer need to import <Html> , <Head> , and <Body> from Next.js. Instead, you just use React. app/layout.js // New: App Router ‚ú® // The root layout is shared for the entire application export default function RootLayout ({ children }) { return ( < html lang = \"en\" > < body >{children}</ body > </ html > ); } The opportunity to build a new file-system router was also the right time to address many other related feature requests with our routing system. For example: Previously, you could only import global stylesheets from external npm packages (like component libraries) in _app.js . This was a less-than-ideal developer experience. With the App Router, you can import (and colocate) any CSS file in any component. Previously, opt-ing into server-side rendering with Next.js (through getServerSideProps ) meant that interacting with your application was blocked until the entire page was hydrated. With the App Router, we've refactored the architecture to be deeply integrated with React Suspense, meaning we can selectively hydrate parts of the page, without blocking other components in the UI from being interactive. Content can be instantly streamed from the server, improving the perceived loading performance of a page. The router is the core of what makes Next.js work. But it's not about the router itself, but how it integrates the rest of the pieces of the framework‚Äîlike data fetching . Only JavaScript. Everything is a function Next.js and React developers want to write JavaScript and TypeScript code and compose application components together. From our original post: pages/index.js import React from 'react' ; import Head from 'next/head' ; export default () => ( < div > < Head > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> </ Head > < h1 >Hi. I'm mobile-ready!</ h1 > </ div > ); In future versions of Next.js, we added a DX improvement to automatically import React for you. This component encapsulates logic that can be reused and composed anywhere in your application. Paired with file-system routing, this meant an easy way to get started building React applications that felt like writing JavaScript and HTML. For example, if you wanted to fetch some data, the original version of Next.js looked like this: pages/index.js import React from 'react' ; import 'isomorphic-fetch' ; export default class extends React . Component { static async getInitialProps () { const res = await fetch ( 'https://api.company.com/user/123' ); const data = await res .json (); return { username : data . profile .username }; } } In future versions of Next.js, we added a DX improvement that polyfilled fetch so you didn't need to import isomorphic-fetch or node-fetch , and could use the Web fetch API on both the client and server. As adoption grew and the framework matured, we explored new patterns for data fetching. getInitialProps ran both the server and client. This API extended the React component, allowing you to make a Promise and forward the results to the component's props . While getInitialProps does still work today, we then iterated forward on the next generation of data fetching APIs based on customer feedback: getServerSideProps and getStaticProps . pages/index.js // Generate a static version of the route export async function getStaticProps (context) { return { props : {} }; } // Or dynamically server-render the route export async function getServerSideProps (context) { return { props : {} }; } These APIs made it more clear where your code was running, either the client or server, and allowed Next.js applications to be automatically statically optimized . Further, it allowed for static exports , enabling Next.js to be deployed to places that don't support a server (e.g. AWS S3 bucket). However, this was not \"just JavaScript\", and we wanted to adhere closer to our original design principle. Since Next.js was created, we've worked closely with the React core team at Meta to build framework features on top of React primitives. Our partnership, in combination with the years of research and development from the React core team, has led to an opportunity for Next.js to achieve our goals through the latest version of the React architecture, including Server Components . With the App Router, you fetch data using the familiar async and await syntax. There are no new APIs to learn. By default, all components are React Server Components, so data fetching happens securely on the server. For example: app/page.js export default async function Page () { const res = await fetch ( 'https://api.example.com/...' ); // The return value is *not* serialized // You can use Date, Map, Set, etc. const data = res .json (); return '...' ; } Critically, the \"data fetching is up to the developer\" principle is realized. You can fetch data and compose any component. And not just first-party components, but any component in the Server Components ecosystem, like a Twitter embed react-tweet , which has been designed to integrate with Server Components and run entirely on the server. app/page.js import { Tweet } from 'react-tweet' ; export default async function Page () { return < Tweet id = \"790942692909916160\" />; } Since the router is integrated with React Suspense , you can more fluidly display fallback content while parts of your content are loading, and progressively reveal content as desired. app/page.js import { Suspense } from 'react' ; import { PostFeed , Weather } from './components' ; export default function Page () { return ( < section > < Suspense fallback = {< p >Loading feed...</ p >}> < PostFeed /> </ Suspense > < Suspense fallback = {< p >Loading weather...</ p >}> < Weather /> </ Suspense > </ section > ); } Further, the router marks page navigations as transitions , enabling route transitions to be interruptible. Automatic server rendering and code splitting When we created Next.js, it was still common for developers to manually configure webpack, babel, and other tooling to get a React application running. Adding further optimizations like server rendering or code splitting was often not implemented in custom solutions. Next.js, as well as other React frameworks, created an abstraction layer to implement and force these best practices. Route-based code splitting meant that each file in your pages/ directory would be code split into its own JavaScript bundle, helping reduce the file system and improve initial page load performance. This was beneficial for both server-rendered applications as well as single-page applications with Next.js, as the latter often loaded a single large JavaScript bundle on application startup. However, to implement component-level code splitting, developers needed to use next/dynamic to dynamically import components. app/page.tsx import dynamic from 'next/dynamic' ; const DynamicHeader = dynamic (() => import ( '../components/header' ) , { loading : () => < p >Loading...</ p > , }); export default function Home () { return < DynamicHeader />; } With the App Router, Server Components are not included in the JavaScript bundle for the browser. Client components are automatically code split by default (either with webpack or Turbopack in Next.js). Further, since the entire router architecture is streaming and Suspense enabled, you can progressively send parts of your UI from the server to the client. For example, you can code split entire code paths with conditional logic. In this example, you would not need to load the dashboard's client-side JavaScript for logged-out users. app/layout.tsx import { getUser } from './auth' ; import { Dashboard , Landing } from './components' ; export default async function Layout () { const isLoggedIn = await getUser (); return isLoggedIn ? < Dashboard /> : < Landing />; } Turbopack (Beta) Turbopack , our new bundler we're testing and stabilizing through Next.js, helps speed up local iterations while working on your Next.js application (through next dev --turbo ) and soon your production builds ( next build --turbo ). Since the alpha release in Next.js 13, we've seen a steady growth in adoption as we've worked to patch bugs and add support for missing features. We've been dogfooding Turbopack on Vercel.com and with many Vercel customers operating large Next.js websites to gather feedback and improve stability. We are grateful for the community's support in testing and reporting bugs to our team. Now six months later, we're ready to move forward into the beta phase. Turbopack does not yet have full feature parity with webpack and Next.js. We are tracking support for those features in this issue . However, the majority of use cases should now be supported. Our goal with this beta is to continue addressing remaining bugs from increased adoption and prepare for stability in a future version. Our investment into improving the incremental engine and caching layer of Turbopack will not only speed up local development, but also production builds soon. Stay tuned for a future Next.js version where you'll be able to run next build --turbo for instant builds. Try out the Turbopack beta today in Next.js 13.4 with next dev --turbo . Server Actions (Alpha) The React ecosystem has seen a lot of innovation and exploration of ideas around forms, managing form state, and caching and revalidating of data. Over time, React has become more opinionated about some of these patterns. For example, recommended \"uncontrolled components\" for form state. The current ecosystem of solutions has either been reusable client-side solutions or primitives built into frameworks. Until now, there hasn't been a way to compose server mutations and data primitives. The React team has been working on a first-party solution for mutations. We're excited to announce support for experimental Server Actions in Next.js , enabling you to mutate data on the server, calling functions directly without needing to create an in-between API layer. app/post/[id]/page.tsx (Server Component) import kv from './kv' ; export default function Page ({ params }) { async function increment () { 'use server' ; await kv .incr ( ` post :id: ${ params .id } ` ); } return ( < form action = {increment}> < button type = \"submit\" >Like</ button > </ form > ); } With Server Actions, you have powerful server-first data mutations, less client-side JavaScript, and progressively enhanced forms. app/post/new/page.tsx (Server Component) import db from './db' ; import { redirect } from 'next/navigation' ; async function create (formData : FormData ) { 'use server' ; const post = await db . post .insert ({ title : formData .get ( 'title' ) , content : formData .get ( 'content' ) , }); redirect ( `/blog/ ${ post .slug } ` ); } export default function Page () { return ( < form action = {create}> < input type = \"text\" name = \"title\" /> < textarea name = \"content\" /> < button type = \"submit\" >Submit</ button > </ form > ); } Server Actions in Next.js have been designed for deep integration with the rest of the data lifecycle, including the Next.js Cache, Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and the client router. Revalidating data through new APIs revalidatePath and revalidateTag mean that mutating, re-rendering the page, or redirecting can happen in one network roundtrip , ensuring the correct data is displayed on the client, even if the upstream provider is slow. app/dashboard/posts/page.tsx (Server Component) import db from './db' ; import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache' ; async function update (formData : FormData ) { 'use server' ; await db . post .update ({ title : formData .get ( 'title' ) , }); revalidateTag ( 'posts' ); } export default async function Page () { const res = await fetch ( 'https://...' , { next : { tags : [ 'posts' ] } }); const data = await res .json (); // ... } Server Actions are designed to be composable. Anyone in the React community can build and publish Server Actions and distribute them in the ecosystem. Just like Server Components, we're excited about the new era of composable primitives for both the client and the server. Server Actions are available today in alpha with Next.js 13.4. By opting into using Server Actions, Next.js will use the experimental release channel of React. next.config.js /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */ const nextConfig = { experimental : { serverActions : true , } , }; module . exports = nextConfig; Other Improvements Draft Mode : Fetch and render draft content from your headless CMS. Draft mode works in both pages and app . We've enhanced and simplified the existing Preview Mode API, which continues to work for pages . Preview Mode does not work in app ‚Äîyou should use Draft Mode. Frequently Asked Questions What does App Router stability mean? Marking the App Router as stable today does not mean our work is done. Stability means that the core of the App Router is ready for production and has been validated by both our own internal testing, as well as many Next.js early adopters. There are still additional optimizations we'd like to make in the future, including Server Actions reaching full stability. It was important for us to push towards core stability to help provide clarity for the community on where they should begin learning and building applications today. The App Router is built on top of the React canary channel, which is now ready for framework adoption of features like Server Components. Learn more . What does this mean for the Next.js beta docs? Starting today, we recommend building new applications with the App Router. The Next.js beta documentation, which has been used to explain the App Router and re-written from the ground up, is now merged back into the stable Next.js documentation . You can now easily toggle between the App or Pages Router. We recommend reading the App Router Incremental Adoption Guide to learn how to adopt the App Router. Is the Pages Router going away? No. We are committed to supporting pages/ development, including bug fixes, improvements, and security patches, for multiple major versions moving forward. We want to ensure developers have enough time to incrementally adopt the App Router as they're ready. Using both pages/ and app/ in production together is supported and encouraged. The App Router can be adopted on a per-route basis . Does this mean Server Components are \"complete\"? Next.js is one framework that is choosing the build on the React architecture, which includes Server Components. We hope that the experience provided with the App Router will encourage other frameworks (or new frameworks) to consider using this architecture, as well. There are still patterns yet to be defined in this ecosystem, like handling infinite scroll. For now, we recommend using client solutions for these patterns while the ecosystem grows and libraries are created or updated.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Wednesday, November 18th 2020 Incrementally Adopting Next.js Posted by Lee Robinson @ leeerob Next.js has been designed for gradual adoption. With Next.js, you can continue using your existing code and add as much (or as little) React as you need. By starting small and incrementally adding more pages, you can prevent derailing feature work by avoiding a complete rewrite. Many companies need to modernize their tech stack to reduce costs, increase developer productivity, and provide the best experience for their customers. Component-driven development has greatly improved the deployment velocity and reusability of modern codebases. And with over 8 million downloads/month , React is the leading component-driven choice for developers. Next.js, the React framework for production, enables you to incrementally adopt React. Motivation In an increasingly mobile world, improving and tracking your Core Web Vitals is critical for success. Your customers are likely distributed across the world with varying internet speeds. Every second (or millisecond) of additional time spent waiting for a page to load or an action to complete could be the difference between a sale, impression, or conversion. If you're modernizing your tech stack, you might be facing challenges like: Your application has years of legacy code that is difficult to reason about and would take years (and millions of dollars) to rewrite completely. Your page load times continue to increase as the size and complexity of the application grows. Simple marketing pages are as slow as the most complex pages. You're trying to scale your development team, but are facing issues adding more developers into the existing codebase. You have outdated CI/CD and DevOps processes, which decrease developer productivity and make it difficult to safely and reliably roll out new changes. Your application is not responsive for mobile devices and it's impossible to update the global page styling without breaking other parts of the application. You know you need to do something, but it can be overwhelming to understand where to start . By incrementally adopting Next.js, you can begin to solve the above issues and transform your application. Let's discuss a few different strategies for adopting Next.js into your existing tech stack. Strategies Subpath The first strategy is to configure your server or proxy such that, everything under a specific subpath points to a Next.js app. For example, your existing website might be at example.com , and you might configure your proxy such that example.com/store serves a Next.js e-commerce store. Using basePath , you can configure your Next.js application's assets and links to automatically work with your new subpath /store . Since each page in Next.js is its own standalone route , pages like pages/products.js will route to example.com/store/products in your application. next.config.js module . exports = { basePath : '/store' , }; To learn more about basePath , take a look at our documentation . ( Note: This feature was introduced in Next.js 9.5 and up. If you‚Äôre using older versions of Next.js, please upgrade before trying it out.) Rewrites The second strategy is to create a new Next.js app that points to the root URL of your domain. Then, you can use rewrites inside next.config.js to have some subpaths to be proxied to your existing app. For example, let's say you created a Next.js app to be served from example.com with the following next.config.js . Now, requests for the pages you‚Äôve added to this Next.js app (e.g. /about if you‚Äôve added pages/about.js ) will be handled by Next.js, and requests for any other route (e.g. /dashboard ) will be proxied to proxy.example.com . next.config.js module . exports = { async rewrites () { return [ // we need to define a no-op rewrite to trigger checking // all pages/static files before we attempt proxying { source : '/:path*' , destination : '/:path*' , } , { source : '/:path*' , destination : `https://proxy.example.com/:path*` , } , ]; } , }; To learn more about rewrites, take a look at our documentation . Micro-Frontends with Monorepos and Subdomains Next.js and Vercel make it easy to adopt micro-frontends and deploy as a Monorepo . This allows you to use subdomains to adopt new applications incrementally. Some benefits of micro-frontends: Smaller, more cohesive and maintainable codebases. More scalable organizations with decoupled, autonomous teams. The ability to upgrade, update, or even rewrite parts of the frontend in a more incremental fashion. The architecture of a monorepo deployed to Vercel. Once your monorepo is set up, push changes to your Git repository as usual and you'll see the commits deployed to the Vercel projects you've connected. Say goodbye to outdated CI/CD processes. An example of Deployment URLs provided by a Git Integration. Conclusion Next.js was designed for incremental adoption into your existing tech stack. The Vercel platform makes it a collaborative experience with deploy previews for every code change, by seamlessly integrating with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Instantly preview changes locally with Fast Refresh , increasing developer productivity. Push changes to create a Branch Preview , optimized for collaboration with stakeholders. Deploy to production with Vercel by merging the PR. No complicated DevOps. To learn more, read about subpaths and rewrites or deploy an example with micro-frontends .",

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, January 9th 2020 New Next.js Documentation Posted by JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Joe Haddad @ timer150 Luis Alvarez @ luis_fades Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens We're excited to announce the new Next.js documentation, featuring: Improved Content : New sections explaining core concepts and features have been added. Search : Fuzzy search through the documentation using the new sidebar. API Reference One of the most requested documentation additions. The Next.js documentation now has a separate API reference. Part of the Next.js GitHub repository : The documentation content still lives in the Next.js repository. Ensuring updates to documentation are synchronous with new features. In addition to the new and improved documentation, we've made some changes to nextjs.org/learn , making it even easier to get started using Next.js: Login is no longer required : We've removed the login with GitHub, so you can start learning right away. You can still earn points! New API Routes lesson : A new lesson explains the basics of creating an API endpoint with Next.js and how to fetch it with SWR . Improved Content Previously, the Next.js documentation lived in a single readme.md document. Over the past 3 years the documentation consistently improved, growing in size to cover all areas of the framework. Over time the documentation page became quite long and we started getting community feedback that it would be preferable for the documentation to be split into smaller chunks so that they could be independently consumed and searched for. As with all our releases, we closely collaborated with community members to find the optimal page structure. We decided to have a multi-page structure where every section explains a separate concept. Allowing users to find the relevant content quicker. The sidebar was also updated to better sort the content with a focus on the core features and concepts, instead of showing everything and combining advanced features with basic ones. In addition to improving the structure, a few new sections were added to the documentation.\nMost notably: nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts : what pages are in Next.js and how they relate to static generation and server-side rendering. nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing : The different types of routes that are supported on the filesystem. Getting Started documentation page Search With moving to multi-page documentation you lose one important benefit of a single documentation page, being able to search using cmd + f (or ctrl + f on Windows/Linux). We've added a new search input to the documentation sidebar that allows you to fuzzy search through all documentation pages. This addition allows the documentation to still feel like a single page. Search for TypeScript in the documentation. API Reference The sidebar now has a dedicated API Reference section. This addition to the documentation was frequently requested by companies and community members that use Next.js often and just wanted to look up what parameter to pass or which function to call. Previously these references were interleaved with the explanation of the feature. Documentation in the API Reference Part of the Next.js GitHub repository Since the beginning of the project, the single location for Next.js documentation has been the readme.md living in the GitHub repository. When the nextjs.org website launched, we would manually keep the documentation changes up to date by periodically copying the content from the Next.js GitHub repository to the website GitHub repository. The reason we had to do this was that page on the website was powered by MDX . Manually copying is not ideal and we started investigating better solutions to the problem. We wanted the new way of contributing to the documentation to be as low-friction as the current way, updating markdown files in the Next.js GitHub repository without needing knowledge about how the website works. By using Next.js' new support for static generation on a per-page basis ( proposal ) we were able to keep the documentation in the Next.js repository. The markdown from the raw GitHub file url gets fetched and rendered to HTML in getStaticProps . Resulting in less JavaScript being sent to the browser, as MDX was no longer needed. We also wanted to make it easier to contribute to individual documentation pages. To achieve this we've added a \"Edit this page on GitHub\" link at the bottom of every documentation page. Documentation page with link to the markdown file on GitHub. When an update to the documentation is made, it'll be released with every new stable release automatically. Keeping the documentation always up to date with new releases. nextjs.org/learn Improvements The nextjs.org/learn website is an interactive learning experience that guides you through many of the features Next.js offers by default. Every lesson that is completed you get points awarded. Sometimes a lesson can even have a quiz to reinforce your knowledge of the lesson. To keep track of this progress and the points you've collected we previously asked users to login with their GitHub account. Recently we've lifted this limitation and all lessons are now available without login. Allowing you to start learning Next.js immediately on nextjs.org/learn. New API routes lesson A new lesson was added that explains the basics of creating an API endpoint with Next.js and how to fetch it with SWR . API Routes lesson in nextjs.org/learn. Special thanks to Next.js community member Amandeep Singh for contributing this new lesson. Future We'll keep improving and iterating on the documentation based on user feedback. You can expect new sections about both high and low level concepts that Next.js helps you with. If you have any feedback about the new documentation you can use the feedback input at the bottom of each page on nextjs.org/docs We welcome any community contributions to the documentation. A good place to get started is the \"Good first issue label\" on GitHub.",

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, February 17th 2022 Next.js 12.1 Posted by Bal√°zs Orb√°n @ balazsorban44 DongYoon Kang @ kdy1dev Gerald Monaco @ devknoll Javi Velasco @ javivelasco Jiachi Liu @ huozhi JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Joe Haddad @ timer150 Kara Erickson @ karaforthewin Maia Teegarden @ padmaia Shu Ding @ shuding_ Steven @ styfle Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Tobias Koppers @ wSokra We're excited to release one of our most requested features with Next.js 12.1: On-demand ISR (Beta): Revalidate pages using getStaticProps instantly. Expanded Support for SWC: styled-components , Relay, and more. next/jest Plugin: Zero-configuration Jest support using SWC. Faster Minification with SWC (RC): 7x faster minification than Terser. Self-Hosting Improvements: ~80% smaller Docker images. React 18 & Server Components (Alpha): Improved stability and support. Developer Survey: Help us improve Next.js with your feedback. Update today by running npm i next@latest . On-demand Incremental Static Regeneration (Beta) Next.js now exposes a function unstable_revalidate() allowing you to revalidate individual pages that use getStaticProps . This was one of our most requested features since we introduced Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Next.js 9.5. Since ISR was released, we've seen companies like Tripadvisor , Parachute , HashiCorp, and more drastically improve their build times while retaining incredible performance. However, we've heard your feedback on interval-based revalidations and are excited to provide more flexibility. Currently, if you set a revalidate time of 60 , all visitors will see the same generated version of your site for one minute. The only way to invalidate the cache was from someone visiting that page after the minute had passed. You can now manually purge the Next.js cache for a specific page on-demand. This makes it easier to update your site when: Content from your headless CMS is created or updated Ecommerce metadata changes (price, description, category, reviews, etc.) pages/api/revalidate.js export default async function handler (req , res) { // Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request if ( req . query .secret !== process . env . MY_SECRET_TOKEN ) { return res .status ( 401 ) .json ({ message : 'Invalid token' }); } try { await res .unstable_revalidate ( '/path-to-revalidate' ); return res .json ({ revalidated : true }); } catch (err) { // If there was an error, Next.js will continue // to show the last successfully generated page return res .status ( 500 ) .send ( 'Error revalidating' ); } } Inside getStaticProps , you do not need to specify revalidate to use on-demand revalidation. If revalidate is omitted, Next.js will use the default value of false (no revalidation) and only revalidate the page on-demand when unstable_revalidate() is called. Incremental Static Regeneration works for any providers supporting the Next.js Build API ( next build ). Starting today when deployed to Vercel, on-demand revalidation propagates globally in ~300ms when pushing pages to the edge. View our demo to see on-demand revalidation in action and provide feedback. Svix (enterprise-ready webhooks) and Clerk (authentication) have also created a demo of on-demand ISR. Improved SWC support We want to make every Next.js application build faster for production and get instant feedback in local development. Next.js 12 introduced a new Rust-based compiler that takes advantage of native compilation. With 12.1, we've added support to the Next.js Compiler for: styled-components importSource legacy-decorators relay remove-react-properties remove-console With the above six transforms added, we have now ported the most common Babel plugins to Rust using the new compiler. If there are other plugins you'd like to see, let us know on the discussion . Further, we're working on a system for high-performance WebAssembly plugins enabled through SWC. Zero-configuration Jest plugin Next.js now automatically configures Jest for you ( next/jest ) using the Rust-based Next.js Compiler to transform files, including: Auto mocking stylesheets ( .css , .module.css , and their .scss variants) and image imports Loading .env (and all variants) into process.env Ignoring node_modules from test resolving and transforms Ignoring .next from test resolving Loading next.config.js for flags that enable Next.js compiler transforms Check out the documentation to learn more or get started from our Jest example . Faster minification with SWC With Next.js 12 , we introduced minification using SWC as part of the Next.js Compiler. Early results showed it was 7x faster than Terser. Minification with SWC is now in Release Candidate (RC) with 12.1 and will become the default in 12.2. You can opt-in to using SWC for minification in next.config.js : next.config.js module . exports = { swcMinify : true , }; Let us know your feedback on the discussion . Faster Image Optimization The built-in Image Optimization API has been updated to support the same pattern as ISR pages , where images are served stale and revalidate in the background (also known as stale-while-revalidate ). This is a significant performance improvement for optimizing images. See Image Caching Behavior to learn more. Self-hosted Next.js improvements Next.js can now automatically create a standalone folder that copies only the necessary files for production deployments. This has resulted in ~80% smaller Docker images for self-hosted Next.js applications. To leverage this automatic copying you can enable it in your next.config.js : next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { outputStandalone : true , } , }; This will create a folder at .next/standalone which can then be deployed on its own without installing node_modules . Check out the documentation or get started from the Docker example . We now also have a multi-env Docker example with support for loading different .env files based on the environment. React 18, Server Components, and SSR Streaming (Alpha) As shown at Next.js Conf , we've been working to bring React 18, Server-Side Suspense, Streaming SSR, and eventually Server Components to Next.js. Server Components are a new feature in React that let you reduce your JavaScript bundle size by separating server and client-side code. Server Components allow developers to build apps that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering. For developers following along on the Server Components path from alpha to beta in Next.js, here are some of the recent updates: Inline Server Component responses in the HTML to avoid a second request Improved script loading when streaming to enable partial hydration with React 18 Support for the new useId API in React 18 Support for _app as a Server Component Improved code splitting for Server Components Improved streaming performance Ability to change the default runtime between Node.js and Edge ( RFC ) We're working to enable you to run your entire Next.js application server-rendered at the Edge. You can choose which pages should opt into the Edge Runtime, so you can incrementally migrate pages from Node.js as you're ready. We'll be releasing another post going more in-depth on the Edge Runtime soon. Both of our demos ( next-server-components and next-rsc-demo ) have been updated with the latest changes. Other bug fixes and improvements Using <a> with target=\"blank\" no longer warns to use next/link with ESLint. .d.ts files are no longer considered Pages. document.title now takes priority over h1 when announcing page changes to screen readers. Creating pages/index/[...dynamic].js now works, which previously was not possible due to index being a reserved keyword. When using dynamic(() => import('./some-component'), { ssr: false }) the import will be automatically treeshaken from the server code. To create a smaller installation size and improve security, we're working to precompile more dependencies. The latest addition was node-fetch . Improvements for Fast Refresh when using Middleware . Support for ESLint 8 with our built-in ESLint Integration . styled-jsx has been upgraded to 5.0, including new helpful error links for all styled-jsx compilation errors. Edge Runtime: Support for AbortController and AbortSignal Edge Runtime: CryptoKey and globalThis.CryptoKey added. Large Next.js applications are seeing ~60% improvements on Fast Refresh times with recent improvements (over 1,000 modules being reloaded). A notification is now shown if Fast Refresh fails and causes a full page reload. Announced routes now correctly skip announcing the initial page load when using React 18 strict mode. We have lowered the number of open issues by almost 300 on the Next.js repository compared to December 2021 (resolved almost 1000 issues). Next.js Developer Survey Share your feedback and help us improve Next.js with our first Developer Survey . There are two parts to this survey: a quick survey of eight questions and an extended survey that dives into feedback for individual features. We'd love it if you could fill out both sections if you have time, but if not, feel free to submit your answers after the first section. Your answers will be completely anonymous, though you can choose to share your app URLs with us if you like. Thanks for helping us improve Next.js! Thank you, contributors Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 2,000 individual developers , industry partners like Google and Facebook, and our core team. To make contribution easier, we've migrated the Next.js repository to use Turborepo to improve build performance. We've also added scaffolding for tests and error links to make it easier to get started writing tests. Finally, we recorded a 40-minute walkthrough video showing how to contribute to Next.js.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, April 11th 2024 Next.js 14.2 Posted by Delba de Oliveira @ delba_oliveira Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Next.js 14.2 includes development, production, and caching improvements. Turbopack for Development (Release Candidate): 99.8% tests passing for next dev --turbo . Build and Production Improvements: Reduced build memory usage and CSS optimizations. Caching Improvements: Configurable invalidation periods with staleTimes . Error DX Improvements: Better hydration mismatch errors and design updates. Upgrade today or get started with: Terminal npx create-next-app@latest Turbopack for Development (Release Candidate) Over the past few months, we‚Äôve been working on improving local development performance with Turbopack. In version 14.2, the Turbopack Release Candidate is now available for local development: 99.8% of integrations tests are now passing. We‚Äôve verified the top 300 npm packages used in Next.js applications can compile with Turbopack. All Next.js examples work with Turbopack. We‚Äôve integrated Lightning CSS , a fast CSS bundler and minifier, written in Rust. We‚Äôve been extensively dogfooding Turbopack with Vercel‚Äôs applications. For example, with vercel.com , a large Next.js app, we've seen: Up to 76.7% faster local server startup. Up to 96.3% faster code updates with Fast Refresh. Up to 45.8% faster initial route compile without caching (Turbopack does not have disk caching yet). Turbopack continues to be opt-in and you can try it out with: Terminal next dev --turbo We will now be focusing on improving memory usage, implementing persistent caching, and next build --turbo . Memory Usage - We‚Äôve built low-level tools for investigating memory usage. You can now generate traces that include both performance metrics and broad memory usage information. These traces allows us to investigate performance and memory usage without needing access to your application‚Äôs source code. Persistent Caching - We‚Äôre also exploring the best architecture options, and we‚Äôre expecting to share more details in a future release. next build - While Turbopack is not available for builds yet, 74.7% of tests are already passing. You can follow the progress at areweturboyet.com/build . To see a list of supported and unsupported features in Turbopack, please refer to our documentation . Build and Production Improvements In addition to bundling improvements with Turbopack, we‚Äôve worked to improve overall build and production performance for all Next.js applications (both Pages and App Router). Tree-shaking We identified an optimization for the boundary between Server and Client Components that allows for tree-shaking unused exports. For example, importing a single Icon component from a file that has \"use client\" no longer includes all the other icons from that package. This can largely reduce the production JavaScript bundle size. Testing this optimization on a popular library like react-aria-components reduced the final bundle size by -51.3% . Note: This optimization does not currently work with barrel files. In the meantime, you can use the optimizePackageImports config option: next.config.ts module . exports = { experimental : { optimizePackageImports : [ 'package-name' ] , } , }; Build Memory Usage For extremely large-scale Next.js applications, we noticed out-of-memory crashes (OOMs) during production builds. After investigating user reports and reproductions, we identified the root issue was over-bundling and minification (Next.js created fewer, larger JavaScript files with duplication). We‚Äôve refactored the bundling logic and optimized the compiler for these cases. Our early tests show that on a minimal Next.js app, memory usage and cache file size decreased from 2.2GB to under 190MB on average. To make it easier to debug memory performance, we‚Äôve introduced a --experimental-debug-memory-usage flag to next build . Learn more in our documentation . CSS We updated how CSS is optimized during production Next.js builds by chunking CSS to avoid conflicting styles when you navigate between pages. The order and merging of CSS chunks are now defined by the import order. For example, base-button.module.css will be ordered before page.module.css : base-button.tsx import styles from './base-button.module.css' ; export function BaseButton () { return < button className = { styles .primary} />; } page.tsx import { BaseButton } from './base-button' ; import styles from './page.module.css' ; export function Page () { return < BaseButton className = { styles .primary} />; } To maintain the correct CSS order, we recommend: Using CSS Modules over global styles . Only import a CSS Module in a single JS/TS file. If using global class names, import the global styles in the same JS/TS too. We don‚Äôt expect this change to negatively impact the majority of applications. However, if you see any unexpected styles when upgrading, please review your CSS import order as per the recommendations in our documentation . Caching Improvements Caching is a critical part of building fast and reliable web applications. When performing mutations, both users and developers expect the cache to be updated to reflect the latest changes. We've been exploring how to improve the Next.js caching experience in the App Router. staleTimes (Experimental) The Client-side Router Cache is a caching layer designed to provide a fast navigation experience by caching visited and prefetched routes on the client. Based on community feedback, we‚Äôve added an experimental staleTimes option to allow the client-side router cache invalidation period to be configured. By default, prefetched routes (using the <Link> component without the prefetch prop) will be cached for 30 seconds, and if the prefetch prop is set to true , 5 minutes. You can overwrite these default values by defining custom revalidation times in next.config.js : next.config.ts const nextConfig = { experimental : { staleTimes : { dynamic : 30 , static : 180 , } , } , }; module . exports = nextConfig; staleTimes aims to improve the current experience of users who want more control over caching heuristics, but it is not intended to be the complete solution. In upcoming releases, we will focus on improving the overall caching semantics and providing more flexible solutions. Learn more about staleTimes in our documentation . Parallel and Intercepting Routes We are continuing to iterate on on Parallel and Intercepting Routes, now improving the integration with the Client-side Router Cache. Parallel and Intercepting routes that invoke Server Actions with revalidatePath or revalidateTag will revalidate the cache and refresh the visible slots while maintaining the user‚Äôs current view. Similarly, calling router.refresh now correctly refreshes visible slots, maintaining the current view. Errors DX Improvements In version 14.1, we started working on improving the readability of error messages and stack traces when running next dev . This work has continued into 14.2 to now include better error messages, overlay design improvements for both App Router and Pages Router, light and dark mode support, and clearer dev and build logs. For example, React Hydration errors are a common source of confusion in our community. While we made improvements to help users pinpoint the source of hydration mismatches (see below), we're working with the React team to improve the underlying error messages and show the file name where the error occurred. Before: An example of the Next.js error overlay before version 14.2. After: An example of the Next.js error overlay after version 14.2. React 19 In February, the React team announced the upcoming release of React 19 . To prepare for React 19, we're working on integrating the latest features and improvements into Next.js, and plan on releasing a major version to orchestrate these changes. New features like Actions and their related hooks, which have been available within Next.js from the React canary channel , will now all be available for all React applications (including client-only applications). We're excited to see wider adoption of these features in the React ecosystem. Other Improvements [Docs] New documentation on Video Optimization ( PR ).

Announcing the third global Next.js community conference on October 25th. Register now ‚Üí Next.js Conf You‚Äôre invited to the global Next.js community conference on October 25th. For the 6th anniversary of Next.js, we‚Äôll be introducing: Features that leverage React Server Components, Streaming and Suspense. Conventions that make it easier for developers to optimize and scale applications. Open-source tooling that make local development and production builds faster. Claim your free ticket and see the future of Next.js and React, and follow @nextjs for more announcements soon. We‚Äôre also looking for community talks. Submit a talk proposal and share the story of what you‚Äôre building with Next.js. TypeScript Auto-Install Next.js has built-in support for automatically configuring TypeScript. Previously, adding TypeScript to an existing project required manually installing the necessary dependencies. With this release, Next.js automatically detects when TypeScript files are added to a project, installs the necessary dependencies, and adds a tsconfig.json file. This works when running next dev and next build . Video showing Next.js auto-installing TypeScript. Improved Fast Refresh Fast iterations are critical for your local development workflow. Next.js uses Fast Refresh for instantaneous feedback on edits made to your React components. Hit save and see your changes reflected in the browser without needing to reload the page. With Next.js 12.3, some configuration files now also hot reloaded when making edits, including: .env and env.* variants jsconfig.json tsconfig.json You now do not need to restart your local development server when making changes to these configuration files. Video showing Next.js hot reloading a `.env` file. Image Component next/future/image component (Stable) In Next.js 12.2 , we shared an experimental preview of a new Image component that simplifies how you style images and improves performance by using native browser lazy loading. The new Image component is now stable and no longer requires an experimental flag. Since the last release, we've made further improvements: Added support for fill layout mode that causes the image to fill the parent element. Improved the blur-up placeholder so it works with transparent images, no longer needs <noscript> , and next dev matches next start . Prevented subtle layout shift (browsers other than Chrome) by hiding alt text while image is loading. Required alt property for better accessibility. Fixed onError property when error occurs before hydration. Fixed aspect ratio for statically imported image that has only width or only height property. Improved error messages when using improper settings or configuration. In the future, we plan to rename next/image to next/legacy/image and next/future/image to next/image . This will provide a great experience for new Next.js projects and existing projects will be able to easily migrate using our next/image codemod. We will provide more details leading up to the next major version. For more information on how to use it today, please refer to the documentation which includes a migration guide. Remote Patterns (Stable) remotePatterns allows you to specify wildcards for remote images when using the built-in Image Optimization API. It allows for more powerful matching beyond the existing images.domains configuration, which only performs exact matches on the domain name. This option is now stable and can be used with the following configuration option: next.config.js module . exports = { images : { remotePatterns : [ { // The `src` property hostname must end with `.example.com`, // otherwise the API will respond with 400 Bad Request. protocol : 'https' , hostname : '**.example.com' , } , ] , } , }; Disable Image Optimization (Stable) The Image Optimization API requires a server to optimize images on demand as they‚Äôre requested. This works great when self-hosting with next start or deploying to platforms like Vercel . However, this won't work with next export because it doesn‚Äôt include a server to optimize images. Previously, you would need to configure a 3rd party Image Optimization provider using the loader prop, but now you can disable Image Optimization completely using next.config.js for all instances of next/image . This previously experimental option is now stable and can be used with the following configuration option: next.config.js module . exports = { images : { unoptimized : true , } , }; SWC Minifier (Stable) In Next.js 12, we introduced code minification using SWC as part of the experimental features of Next.js Compiler . Early results showed that minification with SWC was 7x faster than the previous version with Terser. With this release, the feature is stable and you can opt-in using the following next.config.js option: next.config.js module . exports = { swcMinify : true , }; We plan to make the SWC minifier the default in the next major version. New Router and Layouts Update Earlier this year, we published the Layouts RFC which introduced the biggest update to Next.js since it was released in 2016. These changes include a new router built on top of React Server Components. The implementation work has begun and we‚Äôre working towards a public beta in the next major version. Today, we‚Äôre sharing more information about upcoming features, including: Route Groups : Used to opt routes out of layouts, and organize routes without affecting URL paths. Instant Loading States : New file convention to easily add loading UI, built with Suspense. Error Handling : New file convention to easily add nested Error Boundaries and error UI. Templates : New file convention to add shared UI that creates a different instance and doesn‚Äôt share state. Intercepting Routes , Parallel Routes , and Conditional Routes : New conventions that allow you to implement advanced routing patterns. Additionally, in a different RFC , we're exploring adding support for Global CSS Imports in the new app directory . This would allow you to use packages that import their own .css files without additional configuration. Read more about these new features in the Layouts RFC . Other Improvements New documentation on built-in accessibility features of Next.js. create-next-app templates now include dark mode support automatically using your system preference. src/ is now a default linting directory when using the integrated ESLint support . next.config.js now includes schema validation with ajv , helping prevent misuse of configuration options. next.config.js now has an experimental config flag fallbackNodePolyfills: false to prevent Next.js from polyfilling Node.js APIs for the browser (which leads to increased bundle sizes). This option will cause Next.js to show a build-time error showing where the unnecessary import comes from. Community Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 2,000 individual developers , industry partners like Google Chrome and Meta, and our core team at Vercel.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Tuesday, June 28th 2022 Next.js 12.2 Posted by Bal√°zs Orb√°n @ balazsorban44 DongYoon Kang @ kdy1dev Javi Velasco @ javivelasco Jiachi Liu @ huozhi JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Joe Haddad @ timer150 Maia Teegarden @ padmaia Shu Ding @ shuding_ Steven @ styfle Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Tobias Koppers @ wSokra We're laying the foundation for the future of Next.js with 12.2: Middleware (Stable): Dynamic routing for your entire application. On-Demand ISR (Stable): Update content without redeploying. Edge API Routes (Experimental): High performance API endpoints. Edge SSR (Experimental): Server-render your app, at the Edge. SWC Plugins (Experimental): Extend compilation with your own plugins. Improvements to next/image : Including a new next/future/image component. Update today by running npm i next@latest . Middleware (Stable) We're excited to announce Middleware is now stable in 12.2 and has an improved API based on feedback from users. Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, adding headers, or setting cookies. middleware.ts import { NextRequest , NextResponse } from 'next/server' ; // If the incoming request has the \"beta\" cookie // then we'll rewrite the request to /beta export function middleware (req : NextRequest ) { const isInBeta = JSON .parse ( req . cookies .get ( 'beta' ) || 'false' ); req . nextUrl .pathname = isInBeta ? '/beta' : '/' ; return NextResponse .rewrite ( req .nextUrl); } // Supports both a single value or an array of matches export const config = { matcher : '/' , }; To update to the newest API changes for Middleware, please see the migration guide . Try Middleware for free on Vercel or when self-hosting using next start . On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (Stable) On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to update the content on your site without needing to redeploy. This makes it easy to update your site immediately when data changes in your headless CMS or commerce platform. This was one of the most requested features from the community and we're excited it is now stable. pages/api/revalidate.js export default async function handler (req , res) { // Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request if ( req . query .secret !== process . env . MY_SECRET_TOKEN ) { return res .status ( 401 ) .json ({ message : 'Invalid token' }); } try { await res .revalidate ( '/path-to-revalidate' ); return res .json ({ revalidated : true }); } catch (err) { // If there was an error, Next.js will continue // to show the last successfully generated page return res .status ( 500 ) .send ( 'Error revalidating' ); } } Incremental Static Regeneration works for any providers supporting the Next.js Build API ( next build ). When deployed to Vercel , on-demand revalidation propagates globally in ~300ms when pushing pages to the edge. For more information, check out the documentation or view our demo to see on-demand revalidation in action. Edge API Routes (Experimental) Next.js now also supports using the Edge Runtime for API Routes. The Edge Runtime is a lighter-weight runtime than Node.js providing fast startups for low latency. In addition, Edge API Routes support streaming responses from the server. You can set the runtime for an API Route in the config , specifying either nodejs (default) or experimental-edge : pages/api/hello.js import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server' ; export default (req : NextRequest ) => { return new Response ( `Hello, from ${ req .url } I'm now an Edge API Route!` ); }; export const config = { runtime : 'experimental-edge' , }; Because the Edge Runtime is lightweight, it has limitations to accommodate fast startup ‚Äî for example, it does not support Node.js-specific APIs like fs . Therefore, the default runtime for API Routes remains nodejs . For more information, check out the documentation . Edge Server-Rendering (Experimental) Next.js now supports using the Edge Runtime for server rendering. As mentioned above, the Edge Runtime is a lighter-weight runtime than Node.js providing fast startups for low latency. When used with React 18, it enables streaming server-rendering for Pages. Next.js uses Node.js as the default runtime for server-side rendering pages. Starting with 12.2, if you are using React 18 you can opt into using the Edge Runtime. You can set the runtime globally in next.config.js , specifying either nodejs or experimental-edge : next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { runtime : 'experimental-edge' , } , }; Changing the default page runtime affects all pages, including SSR streaming and Server Components features. You can also override this default on a per-page basis, by exporting a runtime config: pages/index.js export const config = { runtime : 'nodejs' , }; export default function Home () {} You can detect which runtime you're using by looking at the process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME Environment Variable during runtime, and examining the options.nextRuntime variable during webpack compilation. For more information, check out the documentation . Improvements to next/image next/future/image component (Experimental) We've heard your feedback on the current Image component and are excited to share an early preview of the new next/image . This new and improved image component requires less client-side JavaScript and simplifies how you style images: Renders a single <img> without <div> or <span> wrappers Added support for canonical style prop Removed layout , objectFit , and objectPosition props in favor of style or className Removed IntersectionObserver implementation in favor of native lazy loading Removed loader config in favor of loader prop Note: no fill mode (yet) so width & height props are required This improves performance because native loading=\"lazy\" doesn't need to wait for React hydration and client-side JavaScript. For more information, check out the documentation . Remote Patterns (Experimental) next/image now supports an experimental configuration option remotePatterns that allows you to specify wildcards for remote images when using the built-in Image Optimization API. This allows for more powerful matching beyond the existing images.domains configuration, which only performs exact matches on the domain name. next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { images : { remotePatterns : [ { // The `src` property hostname must end with `.example.com`, // otherwise this will respond with 400 Bad Request. protocol : 'https' , hostname : '**.example.com' , } , ] , } , } , }; For more information, check out the documentation . Disable Image Optimization The zero-config Image Optimization API prevents the use of next export since it requires a server to optimize images on-demand as they're requested. Until today, users targeting next export needed to configure the loader to use a 3rd party Image Optimization provider, but there was no clear solution if there was no provider available. Starting today, next export users can disable Image Optimization for all instances of next/image with a new configuration property: next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { images : { unoptimized : true , } , } , }; SWC Plugins (Experimental) The Next.js Compiler uses SWC to transform and minify your JavaScript code for production. SWC was introduced in Next.js 12.0 to improve both local development and build performance. You can now add plugins (written in WebAssembly) to customize the SWC transformation behavior during compilation: next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { swcPlugins : [ [ 'css-variable/swc' , { displayName : true , basePath : __dirname }] , ] , } , }; For more information, check out the documentation . React 18 Support Improvements Improved support for CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components and emotion with a smoother upgrade experience and no breaking changes. AMP and HTML post-optimization (CSS, fonts optimizations) are properly supported now. next/head now supports React 18. Next.js' route announcer, which is used to properly announce page transitions to screen readers and other assistive technology, now supports React 18. Other Improvements Support for Emotion transform in the Next.js Compiler. Most features of @emotion/babel-plugin are now supported, and unless you are using importMap , it can be removed. For more information, check out the documentation . Better support for the styled-components transform in the Next.js Compiler by allowing customization of the default options, including the cssProp option. For more information, check out the documentation . Better support for JavaScript ES Modules, so components like next/image and next/link can properly be import ed. next/link no longer requires manually adding <a> as a child. You can now opt into this behavior in a backward-compatible way. We've added experimental support for shipping only modern JavaScript by modifying browsersList . You can opt-into this behavior by setting browsersListForSwc: true and legacyBrowsers: false in the experimental option of next.config.js . New @swc/helpers optimizations prevent duplication across bundles, reducing bundle size by around 2KB in a minimal configuration, and more on larger apps We've significantly reduced the Next.js install size. We did this by moving our monorepo to pnpm , which allows us to remove duplicate packages while creating the pre-compiled versions that we use. This leads to a reduction in install size of 14MB. In our continued effort to improve self-hosting Next.js, we are stabilizing our experimental outputStandalone: true config to output: 'standalone' . This config reduces deployment sizes drastically by only including necessary files/assets, including removing the need for installing all of node_modules in the built deployment package. This config can be seen in action in our with-docker example . Layouts RFC & Advanced Routing Support In case you missed it, last month we announced the Layouts RFC ‚Äì the biggest update to Next.js since it was introduced in 2016 including: Nested Layouts: Build complex applications with nested routes. Designed for Server Components: Optimized for subtree navigation. Improved Data Fetching: Fetch in layouts while avoiding waterfalls. Using React 18 Features: Streaming, Transitions, and Suspense. Client and Server Routing: Server-centric routing with SPA-like behavior. 100% incrementally adoptable : No breaking changes so you can adopt gradually. Advanced Routing Conventions : Offscreen stashing, instant transitions, and more. For more information, check out the RFC or provide feedback . Thank you, contributors Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 2,000 individual developers , industry partners like Google Chrome and Meta, and our core team at Vercel.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Tuesday, October 25th 2022 Next.js 13 Posted by Bal√°zs Orb√°n @ balazsorban44 Delba de Oliveira @ delba_oliveira DongYoon Kang @ kdy1dev Jiachi Liu @ huozhi JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Lee Robinson @ leeerob Maia Teegarden @ padmaia Sebastian Markb√•ge @ sebmarkbage Shu Ding @ shuding_ Steven @ styfle Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens As we announced at Next.js Conf , Next.js 13 (stable) lays the foundations to be dynamic without limits: app Directory (beta): Easier, faster, less client JS. Layouts React Server Components Streaming Turbopack (alpha): Up to 700x faster Rust-based Webpack replacement. New next/image : Faster with native browser lazy loading. New @next/font (beta): Automatic self-hosted fonts with zero layout shift. Improved next/link : Simplified API with automatic <a> . Next.js 13 and the pages directory are stable and ready for production. Update today by running: Terminal npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest New app Directory (Beta) Today, we're improving the routing and layouts experience in Next.js and aligning with the future of React with the introduction of the app directory. This is a follow-up to the Layouts RFC previously published for community feedback. The app directory is currently in beta and we do not recommend using it in production yet. You can use Next.js 13 with the pages directory with stable features like the improved next/image and next/link components, and opt into the app directory at your own pace. The pages directory will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future. The app directory includes support for: Layouts: Easily share UI between routes while preserving state and avoiding expensive re-renders. Server Components: Making server-first the default for the most dynamic applications. Streaming: Display instant loading states and stream in units of UI as they are rendered. Support for Data Fetching: async Server Components and extended fetch API enables component-level fetching. The app directory can be incrementally adopted from your existing pages/ directory. Layouts The app/ directory makes it easy to lay out complex interfaces that maintain state across navigations, avoid expensive re-renders, and enable advanced routing patterns. Further, you can nest layouts, and colocate application code with your routes, like components, tests, and styles. The app/ directory can be incrementally adopted from your existing pages/ directory. Creating routes inside app/ requires a single file, page.js : app/page.js // This file maps to the index route (/) export default function Page () { return < h1 >Hello, Next.js!</ h1 >; } You can then define layouts through the file system. Layouts share UI between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. app/blog/layout.js export default function BlogLayout ({ children }) { return < section >{children}</ section >; } Learn more about layouts and pages or deploy an example to try it out . Server Components The app/ directory introduces support for React's new Server Components architecture. Server and Client Components use the server and the client each for what they're best at - allowing you to build fast, highly-interactive apps with a single programming model that provides a great developer experience. With Server Components, we're laying the foundations to build complex interfaces while reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client , enabling faster initial page loads. When a route is loaded, the Next.js and React runtime will be loaded, which is cacheable and predictable in size. This runtime does not increase in size as your application grows. Further, the runtime is asynchronously loaded, enabling your HTML from the server to be progressively enhanced on the client. Learn more about Server Components or deploy an example to try it out . Streaming The app/ directory introduces the ability to progressively render and incrementally stream rendered units of the UI to the client. With Server Components and nested layouts in Next.js, you're able instantly render parts of the page that do not specifically require data, and show a loading state for parts of the page that are fetching data. With this approach, the user does not have to wait for the entire page to load before they can start interacting with it. You can colocate your application code, such as components, tests, and styles, with your routes. When deployed to Vercel, Next.js 13 applications that use the app/ directory will stream responses by default in both the Node.js and Edge runtimes for improved performance. Learn more about streaming or deploy an example to try it out . Data Fetching React's recent Support for Promises RFC introduces a powerful new way to fetch data and handle promises inside components: app/page.js async function getData () { const res = await fetch ( 'https://api.example.com/...' ); // The return value is *not* serialized // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc. return res .json (); } // This is an async Server Component export default async function Page () { const data = await getData (); return < main >{ /* ... */ }</ main >; } The native fetch Web API has also been extended in React and Next.js. It automatically dedupes fetch requests and provides one flexible way to fetch, cache, and revalidate data at the component level. This means all the benefits of Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are now available through one API: // This request should be cached until manually invalidated. // Similar to `getStaticProps`. // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted. fetch ( URL , { cache : 'force-cache' }); // This request should be refetched on every request. // Similar to `getServerSideProps`. fetch ( URL , { cache : 'no-store' }); // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds. // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option. fetch ( URL , { next : { revalidate : 10 } }); In the app directory, you can fetch data inside layouts, pages , and components ‚Äì including support for streaming responses from the server. We're enabling ergonomic ways to handle loading and error states and stream in UI as it's rendered. In a future release, we'll be improving and simplifying data mutations, as well. With the app/ directory, you can use a new special file loading.js to automatically create Instant Loading UI with Suspense boundaries. We're excited to work with the open-source community, package maintainers, and other companies contributing to the React ecosystem to build for this new era of React and Next.js. The ability to colocate data fetching inside components and ship less JavaScript to the client were two important pieces of community feedback we are excited to include with the app/ directory. Learn more about data fetching or deploy an example to try it out . Introducing Turbopack (Alpha) Next.js 13 includes Turbopack , the new Rust-based successor to Webpack. Webpack has been downloaded over 3 billion times . While it's been an integral part of building the Web, we've hit the limits of the maximum performance possible with JavaScript-based tooling. In Next.js 12, we began our transition to native Rust-powered tooling. We started by migrating away from Babel, which resulted in 17x faster transpilation. Then, we replaced Terser, which resulted in 6x faster minification. It's time to go all-in on native for bundling. Using the Turbopack alpha with Next.js 13 results in: 700x faster updates than Webpack 10x faster updates than Vite 4x faster cold starts than Webpack Turbopack is our Rust-based successor to Webpack, with 700x faster HMR for large applications. Turbopack only bundles the minimum assets required in development, so startup time is extremely fast. On an application with 3,000 modules, Turbopack takes 1.8 seconds to boot up. Vite takes 11.4 seconds and Webpack takes 16.5 seconds . Turbopack has out-of-the-box support for Server Components, TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more. During the alpha, many features are not yet supported. We'd love to hear your feedback on using Turbopack to speed up your local iterations. Note: Turbopack in Next.js currently only supports next dev . View the supported features . We are also working to add support for next build through Turbopack. Try out the Turbopack alpha today in Next.js 13 with next dev --turbo . next/image Next.js 13 introduces a powerful new Image component , allowing you to easily display images without layout shift and optimize files on-demand for increased performance. During the Next.js Community Survey, 70% of respondents told us they used the Next.js Image component in production, and in turn, saw improved Core Web Vitals . With Next.js 13, we're improving next/image even further. The new Image component: Ships less client-side JavaScript Easier to style and configure More accessible requiring alt tags by default Aligns with the Web platform Faster because native lazy loading doesn't require hydration app/page.js import Image from 'next/image' ; import avatar from './lee.png' ; export default function Home () { // \"alt\" is now required for improved accessibility // optional: image files can be colocated inside the app/ directory return < Image alt = \"leeerob\" src = {avatar} placeholder = \"blur\" />; } Learn more about the Image component or deploy an example to try it out . Upgrading next/image to Next.js 13 The old Image component was renamed to next/legacy/image . We've provided a codemod that will automatically update your existing usage of next/image to next/legacy/image . For example, this command would run the codemod on your ./pages directory when run from the root: Terminal npx @next/codemod next-image-to-legacy-image ./pages Learn more about the codemod . @next/font Next.js 13 introduces a brand new font system that: Automatically optimizes your fonts, including custom fonts Removes external network requests for improved privacy and performance Built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file Zero layout shift automatically using the CSS size-adjust property This new font system allows you to conveniently use all Google Fonts with performance and privacy in mind. CSS and font files are downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static assets. No requests are sent to Google by the browser. app/layout.js / pages/_app.js import { Inter } from '@next/font/google' ; const inter = Inter (); < html className = { inter .className}></ html >; Custom fonts are also supported, including support for automatic self-hosting, caching, and preloading of font files. app/layout.js / pages/_app.js import localFont from '@next/font/local' ; const myFont = localFont ({ src : './my-font.woff2' }); < html className = { myFont .className}></ html >; You can customize every part of the font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and no layout shift, including the font-display , preloading, fallbacks, and more. Learn more about the new Font component or deploy an example to try it out . next/link next/link no longer requires manually adding <a> as a child. This was added as an experimental option in 12.2 and is now the default. In Next.js 13, <Link> always renders an <a> and allows you to forward props to the underlying tag. For example: import Link from 'next/link' // Next.js 12: `<a>` has to be nested otherwise it's excluded < Link href = \"/about\" > < a >About</ a > </ Link > // Next.js 13: `<Link>` always renders `<a>` < Link href = \"/about\" > About </ Link > Learn more about the improved Link component or deploy an example to try it out . Upgrading next/link to Next.js 13 To upgrade your links to Next.js 13, we've provided a codemod that will automatically update your codebase. For example, this command would run the codemod on your ./pages directory when run from the root: Terminal npx @next/codemod new-link ./pages Learn more about the codemod or check out the documentation. OG Image Generation Social cards, also known as open graph images, can massively increase the engagement rate of clicks on your content, with some experiments showing up to 40% better conversions. Static social cards are time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to maintain. Because of this, social cards are often lacking or even skipped. Until today, dynamic social cards that need to be personalized and computed on the fly were difficult and expensive. We've created a new library @vercel/og that works seamlessly with Next.js to generate dynamic social cards. pages/api/og.jsx import { ImageResponse } from '@vercel/og' ; export const config = { runtime : 'experimental-edge' , }; export default function () { return new ImageResponse ( ( < div style = {{ display : 'flex' , fontSize : 128 , background : 'white' , width : '100%' , height : '100%' , }} > Hello, World! </ div > ) , ); } This approach is 5x faster than existing solutions by using Vercel Edge Functions, WebAssembly, and a brand new core library for converting HTML and CSS into images and leveraging the React component abstraction. Learn more about OG Image Generation or deploy an example to try it out . Middleware API Updates In Next.js 12, we introduced Middleware to enable full flexibility with the Next.js router. We've heard your feedback on the initial API design and have added some additions to improve the developer experience and add powerful new functionality. You can now more easily set headers on the request: middleware.ts import { NextResponse } from 'next/server' ; import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server' ; export function middleware (request : NextRequest ) { // Clone the request headers and set a new header `x-version` const requestHeaders = new Headers ( request .headers); requestHeaders .set ( 'x-version' , '13' ); // You can also set request headers in NextResponse.rewrite const response = NextResponse .next ({ request : { // New request headers headers : requestHeaders , } , }); // Set a new response header `x-version` response . headers .set ( 'x-version' , '13' ); return response; } You can also now provide a response directly from Middleware, without having to rewrite or redirect . middleware.ts import { NextRequest , NextResponse } from 'next/server' ; import { isAuthenticated } from '@lib/auth' ; // Limit the middleware to paths starting with `/api/` export const config = { matcher : '/api/:function*' , }; export function middleware (request : NextRequest ) { // Call our authentication function to check the request if ( ! isAuthenticated (request)) { // Respond with JSON indicating an error message return NextResponse .json ( { success : false , message : 'Auth failed' , } , { status : 401 , } , ); } } Sending responses from Middleware currently requires the experimental.allowMiddlewareResponseBody configuration option inside next.config.js . Breaking Changes The minimum React version has been bumped from 17.0.2 to 18.2.0. The minimum Node.js version has been bumped from 12.22.0 to 14.6.0, since 12.x has reached end-of-life ( PR ). The swcMinify configuration property was changed from false to true . See Next.js Compiler for more info. The next/image import was renamed to next/legacy/image . The next/future/image import was renamed to next/image . A codemod is available to safely and automatically rename your imports. The next/link child can no longer be <a> . Add the legacyBehavior prop to use the legacy behavior or remove the <a> to upgrade. A codemod is available to automatically upgrade your code. Routes are no longer prefetched when the User-Agent is a bot. The deprecated target option of next.config.js has been removed. The supported browsers have been changed to drop Internet Explorer and target modern browsers. You can still use Browserslist to change targeted browsers. Chrome 64+ Edge 79+ Firefox 67+ Opera 51+ Safari 12+ To learn more, check out the upgrade guide . Community Six years ago, we released Next.js to the public. We set out to build a zero-configuration React framework that simplifies your developer experience. Looking back, it's incredible to see how the community has grown, and what we've been able to ship together. Let's keep going. Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 2,400 individual developers , industry partners like Google and Meta, and our core team. With over 3 million npm downloads per week and 94,000 GitHub stars, Next.js is one of the most popular ways of building the Web. Special thanks to the Aurora team at Google Chrome who helped with the foundational research and experiments that led to this release.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, February 23rd 2023 Next.js 13.2 Posted by Casey Gowrie @ GowrieCasey Jimmy Lai @ feedthejim Luba Kravchenko @ lubakravche Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Next.js 13.2 includes major improvements to the App Router ( app ) in preparation for stability: Built-in SEO Support: New Metadata API to set static and dynamic meta tags. Route Handlers : Custom request handlers, built on Web Request and Response . MDX for Server Components: Use React components inside Markdown, server-side only. Rust MDX Parser: Faster Markdown parsing with a brand new Rust plugin. Improved Error Overlay: Separate Next.js and React stack traces for improved readability. Statically Typed Links (Beta): Prevent broken links with next/link and TypeScript. Turbopack Improvements (Alpha): Compatibility with Webpack loaders and improved support. Next.js Cache (Beta): Progressive ISR and faster re-deploys of code changes. Update today by running: Terminal npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest Built-in SEO support with new Metadata API Next.js has been designed from the beginning to enable optimization for search engines . Serving pre-rendered HTML content not only helps improve indexing for search engines but also improves the performance of your application. While Next.js has provided a simple API for modifying metadata in your application ( next/head ) for many versions, we wanted to redesign and enhance how you optimize for search engines with the App Router ( app ). The new Metadata API allows you to define metadata (e.g. meta and link tags inside your HTML head element) with an explicit metadata configuration in any layout or page that is a Server Component. app/layout.tsx import type { Metadata } from 'next' ; export const metadata : Metadata = { title : 'Home' , description : 'Welcome to Next.js' , }; This API is simple, composable, and designed to be compatible with streaming server rendering. For example, you can set common metadata attributes in your root layout for the entire application, and compose and merge metadata objects together for other routes in your application. This includes support for dynamic metadata as well as static: layout.js / page.js // Static metadata export const metadata = { title : '...' , }; // Dynamic metadata export async function generateMetadata ({ params , searchParams }) { const product = await getProduct ( params .id); return { title : product .title }; } All metadata options are available, including the ability to provide custom metadata, with support for TypeScript through the TypeScript plugin or by adding the Metadata type. For example, you can define open graph images through metadata: app/layout.tsx export const metadata = { openGraph : { title : 'Next.js' , description : 'The React Framework for the Web' , url : 'https://nextjs.org' , siteName : 'Next.js' , images : [ { url : 'https://nextjs.org/og.png' , width : 800 , height : 600 , } , ] , locale : 'en-US' , type : 'website' , } , }; export default function Layout ({ children }) {} The Metadata API is available in 13.2 for the App Router ( app ), replacing the previous head.js special file. It is not available for the pages directory. Learn more about SEO or view the API reference for Metadata . We'd like to thank next-seo for their work on the community package and feedback on the initial API design. Custom Route Handlers One of the missing pieces for the original beta release of the App Router ( app ) was API Routes, which exist in the pages/api directory. We wanted to take this opportunity to create a new, more modern version of API Routes that were deeply integrated into the new routing system for app . Route Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs. app/example/route.ts export async function GET (request : Request ) {} Route Handlers have an isomorphic API to support both Edge and Node.js runtimes seamlessly, including support for streaming responses. Since Route Handlers use the same route segment configuration as pages and layouts, they support long-awaited features like general-purpose Static Rendering and Revalidation . A route.ts file can export an async function named by the HTTP verbs: GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , POST , PUT , DELETE , and PATCH . These functions can then be wrapped and abstracted to create helpers / reusable logic for your custom route logic. Other server functions, like cookies and headers , can be used inside Route Handlers ‚Äì along with any Web APIs these abstractions are built upon. This allows for code to be shared between Server Components and Route Handlers. app/example/route.ts import { cookies } from 'next/headers' ; export async function GET (request : Request ) { const cookieStore = cookies (); const token = cookieStore .get ( 'token' ); return new Response ( 'Hello, Next.js!' , { status : 200 , headers : { 'Set-Cookie' : `token= ${ token } ` } , }); } Route Handlers are available in 13.2 for the App Router ( app ) using the route.ts special file. They are not available in the pages directory, as they are a replacement for API Routes. Learn more about Route Handlers or view the API reference . We'd like to thank SvelteKit for their prior art and inspiration here. MDX for Server Components MDX is a superset of markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content. With 13.2, you can now use MDX entirely with React Server Components ‚Äì meaning less client-side JavaScript for faster page loads, all while retaining the powerful capabilities of React for templating dynamic UI. You can sprinkle interactivity into your MDX content as needed. The @next/mdx plugin has been updated with support for a new special file, mdx-components.js|ts , defined at the root of your application to provide custom components: your-project/mdx-components.js // This file allows you to provide custom React components // to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any // React component you want, including components from // other libraries. function H1 ({ children }) { // ... } function H2 ({ children }) { // ... } export function useMDXComponents (components) { return { h1 : H1 , h2 : H2 , ... components }; } Further, we've worked with community packages for fetching MDX content next-mdx-remote and contentlayer to add support for React Server Components. Learn more about how to setup MDX with Server Components or deploy our example . Rust MDX Parser As part of enabling MDX for Server Components, we've also rewritten the MDX parser in Rust to improve performance. This is a significant improvement over the previous JavaScript-based parser, which saw noticable slowdowns when processing a large number of MDX files. You can opt-into using the Rust parser in next.config.js . For example, with @next/mdx : next.config.js /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */ const nextConfig = { experimental : { appDir : true , mdxRs : true , } , }; const withMDX = require ( '@next/mdx' )(); module . exports = withMDX (nextConfig); We'd like to thank Titus Wormer who we sponsored to work on this project. If you'd like to use this outside of Next.js, check out the new package mdxjs-rs . Statically Typed Links Next.js can now statically type links in the app directory to prevent typos and other errors when using next/link , improving type safety when navigating between pages. import Link from 'next/link' // ‚úÖ < Link href = \"/about\" /> // ‚úÖ < Link href = \"/blog/nextjs\" /> // ‚úÖ < Link href = { `/blog/ ${ slug } ` } /> // ‚ùå TypeScript errors if href is not a valid route < Link href = \"/aboot\" /> This feature requires using the new App Router, as well as TypeScript. next.config.js /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */ const nextConfig = { experimental : { appDir : true , typedRoutes : true , } , }; module . exports = nextConfig; This feature is now available in beta. rewrites and redirects are not yet supported. Learn more about statically typed routes . Improved Error Overlay To help improve the readability and debugability of errors, we've made a number of improvements to the Next.js error overlay. In 13.2, Next.js and React stack traces are now separated, making it easier to identify where the error is coming from. Additionally, the error overlay now displays the current version of Next.js, helping you understand whether your version is up to date. The improved error overlay in 13.2 showing version staleness. We've also improved the error output for React hydration errors, which are now more readable and easier to debug. Turbopack Improvements Turbopack , announced in alpha with Next.js 13, is an incremental bundler designed to speed up both local development, as well as production builds in the future. We've been focused on supporting existing Next.js features in Turbopack and improving overall stability as we move towards beta. Since our last release, we've added: Support for next/dynamic Support for rewrites , redirects , headers , and pageExtensions in next.config.js Support for 404s and errors in pages Support for CSS modules composes: ... from ... Improved Fast Refresh reliability and error recovery Improved CSS precedence handling Improved compile-time evaluation We've also fixed many bugs and improved stability while dogfooding Turbopack with some of our largest internal Next.js applications and with early Vercel customers. Custom File Transformation with Webpack Loaders Turbopack now ships with support and compatibility for some webpack loaders. This means that you can use many loaders from the Webpack ecosystem to transform files of different types to JavaScript. Loaders like @mdx-js/loader , @svgr/webpack , and babel-loader are supported. Learn more about customizing Turbopack. For example, use experimental.turbo.loaders to configure a list of loaders for each file extension: next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { turbo : { loaders : { '.md' : [ { // Option format loader : '@mdx-js/loader' , options : { format : 'md' , } , } , ] , '.svg' : [ '@svgr/webpack' ] , } , } , } , }; Check out the Turbopack example using loaders for a complete example. Webpack-style Resolve Aliases Turbopack can now be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's resolve.alias . Configure this through experimental.turbo.resolveAlias : next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { turbo : { resolveAlias : { underscore : 'lodash' , mocha : { browser : 'mocha/browser-entry.js' } , } , } , } , }; Next.js Cache Next.js 13.2 introduces the new Next.js Cache (beta), an evolution of ISR that unlocks: Progressive ISR at the component level Faster refreshes without network requests Faster redeploys of code changes to static pages For pages that are entirely static, ISR works the same way as today. For pages that have more granular data fetching, mixing static and dynamic, the Next.js Cache uses a more granular, ephemeral cache. With the foundation of React Server Components and colocated data fetching in the Next.js App Router ( app ), you can now encapsulate static or dynamic data alongside their consuming component. app/page.jsx export default async function Page () { const [ staticData , dynamicData , revalidatedData ] = await Promise .all ([ // Cached until manually invalidated fetch ( `https://...` ) , // Refetched on every request fetch ( `https://...` , { cache : 'no-store' }) , // Cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds fetch ( `https://...` , { next : { revalidate : 10 } }) , ]); return < div >...</ div >; } While developing locally with the App Router, you'll now see the same caching behavior in next dev as production with next start . This improves the speed of Fast Refresh when any Server Component or data loading code changes. With the Next.js Cache, your app controls the cache‚Äînot third-party APIs. This differs from cache-control headers, where the upstream controls how long the value is cached. Next.js Cache with the Vercel Cache API Next.js on Vercel gives you framework-defined infrastructure. You write application code, like component-level data fetching with fetch , and we scaffold globally distributed infrastructure for you with no additional effort. The new Next.js Cache makes changing code independent from changing data. This can drastically speed up the redeployment of static pages, since the generation of these pages can use the existing cache. This new Vercel Cache API is designed to work with any framework, but has native integration with the Next.js Cache. Learn more about how ISR evolved into the Next.js Cache , as well as how the Next.js Cache works when deploy to Vercel. Next.js Cache when Self-Hosted When self-hosting, an LRU cache is used, which defaults to 50 MB. All entries into the cache are automatically written to disk by default. This filesystem cache can be shared between nodes if they have the same cache key, similar to how ISR works today . For developers looking to further customize and modify the core of the Next.js Cache, they can modify underlying cache keys and change how and where cache entries are persisted, including disabling persistence entirely. Other Improvements Fonts: Following incredible community adoption, @next/font is now built-in to Next.js as next/font . This means you no longer need to install @next/font separately. Learn more . Fonts: The default font-display property for next/font has been changed to font-display: swap instead of optional based on community feedback. Performance: Optimized the build process to use less memory, ~550MB saved in our tests ( PR ). Performance: Avoid loading project configuration multiple times, leading to ~400ms faster builds (average) in our tests ( PR ). Performance: Optimized the error component to reduce 0.4kb of the HTML payload without changing the styling ( PR ). Performance: Reduced the edge bundle size by ~130KB, almost half of the size, to further decrease the cold boot size when deployed to edge environments like Vercel ( PR ). Security: Added configuration images.contentDispositionType: \"attachment\" to force download images when visiting the Image Optimization API directly ( PR ). Community Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 2,500 individual developers, industry partners like Google and Meta, and our core team at Vercel. With over 3.9 million npm downloads per week and 100,000+ GitHub stars, Next.js is one of the most popular ways of building the Web. Join the community on GitHub Discussions , Reddit , and Discord .

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Wednesday, October 9th 2019 Introducing Create Next App Posted by Joe Haddad @ timer150 Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens We're delighted today to introduce the new Create Next App. Create Next App sets up a modern React application powered by Next.js in one command. To get started all you have to do is run: Terminal npx create-next-app Create Next App has been rebuilt from the ground up to provide the best possible developer experience: Interactive Experience : Running npx create-next-app (with no arguments) now launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project. Zero Dependencies : Initializing a project is now as quick as one second . Create Next App has zero dependencies and installs in only 604 kB. Before our optimizations, the previous version was 5.38 MB . That's a reduction of more than 4.7 MB ! Offline Support : Create Next App will automatically detect if you're offline and bootstrap your project using your local package cache. New Default Project Template : Create Next App uses a new project template that is designed for a modern Next.js application. Since Create Next App is now maintained alongside Next.js itself, this template will always be up-to-date with the latest Next.js version! Support for Examples : Create Next App can bootstrap your application using an example from the Next.js examples collection (e.g. npx create-next-app --example api-routes ). Tested : The package is part of the Next.js monorepo and tested using the same integration test suite as Next.js itself, ensuring it works as expected with every release. Create Next App was previously a community maintained project, however, we felt it was important to curate the first impression of Next.js. Especially as we recommend it in the Next.js examples collection . We worked with Segment to transfer ownership of the package, and are very grateful for their prior stewardship, especially by Fouad Matin .",

      "title": "Next.js App Router Update | Next.js",
      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, June 22nd 2023 Next.js App Router Update Posted by Delba de Oliveira @ delba_oliveira Lee Robinson @ leeerob The App Router represents a new foundation for the future of Next.js, but we recognize there are opportunities to make the experience better. We'd like to give an update on what our current priorities are. For the upcoming releases of Next.js, we are focusing on the following areas: Improving Performance Improving Stability Improving Developer Education The App Router First, it's helpful to provide some context on how the App Router has been designed. Growing Beyond the Pages Router by Aligning with React As we saw increased adoption and larger scale applications being built with Next.js, we received feedback from the community and identified areas where we started to reach the limits of the Pages Router. Most notably, the Next.js Pages Router was not designed for streaming, a cornerstone primitive in modern React, that helps us address the limitations we were facing and realize our long-term vision for Next.js. Making streaming-friendly framework APIs for data fetching, asset loading, and page metadata, as well as taking advantage of React's newer primitives required large changes to the core architecture of Next.js. We took the opportunity to build on top of the latest React concurrent features , like Server Components, Suspense, and more, which have been designed for streaming architectures . Incremental Adoption is Non-Negotiable We didn't want our community to have to rebuild their entire applications from the ground up to update to the latest version of Next.js. We believe incremental adoption is the best strategy for evolving applications over time. Per-route incremental migration : Without a major rewrite of your application, you can move a single route of your application over the App Router and start to take advantage of new features at your own pace. See our incremental adoption guide or watch a tutorial . Easily rollback : If you are not satisifed with the performance or developer experience of the App Router, you can easily rollback to the Pages Router for that specific route. We are exploring further opportunities to make incremental adoption even easier. Road to Stability We began building the Next.js App Router over a year ago and have been steadily releasing new features and improvements since then. Initial Announcement : In May of that year, we released an RFC to outline our plans for making routing and layouts more flexible. Early Beta : In Next.js 13, we released the first version of the App Router, allowing the community to try it out and provide early feedback. Stable API : Responding to feedback, we focused our efforts on finalizing the core API. In 13.4, we marked the core API of the App Router as stable and ready for wider adoption. Our Current Focus Marking stability signaled to the community that the core API was settled and would not go through major breaking changes that would require rewrites. Since then, we've received lots of valuable feedback and increased adoption has inevitably revealed bugs and opportunities for further improvement. We want you to know that we are not yet satisfied with the experience of using the App Router and it is our top priority moving forward. So, let's talk about the work we're doing to make this experience better. Improving Performance Over the coming months, we're focused on three aspects of performance: local iteration speed, production build times, and serverless performance. Local development performance As Next.js has matured, and the size of applications built with it have grown, we've slowly and incrementally been replacing pieces of its underlying architecture with faster, more scalable tools. Migration Progress : We started with replacing Babel (compilation) and Terser (minification) with SWC . This has helped improve local iteration speeds and production build times. Long-term Investment : Keeping great Fast Refresh performance regardless of an applications size means making Next.js operate as incremental as possible during local development, by only bundling and compiling code as needed. This is why we're currently working on replacing webpack (bundling) with Turbopack , which is built on a low-level incremental computation engine that enables caching down to the level of individual functions. Next.js applications that move to Turbopack will see sustained improvements in Fast Refresh speed even as they grow in size. In the past few months, the Turbo team has been focused on improving Turbopack performance and support for all Next.js features and App Router APIs. Turbopack is currently available in beta ( next dev --turbo ). Improving Today's Architecture : In addition to investing in the future, we are continuing to make performance improvements to our existing webpack architecture. For certain Next.js applications, especially those refreshing thousands of modules, we have seen reports of flakiness with local development and Fast Refresh. We're working to improve performance and reliability here. For example, we recently added in pre-configured settings ( modularizeImports ) to handle large icon libraries that might accidentally force thousands of modules to reload on every request. Build-time performance We are also working on production builds with Turbopack ( next build --turbo ) and have started to land the first pieces of this work. Expect more updates on this in the coming releases. Production performance Finally, on Vercel, we're working to optimize the performance and memory usage of Vercel Functions defined through Next.js application code , ensuring minimal cold starts while retaining the benefits of a scalable serverless architecture. This work has resulted in new tracing capabilities (experimental) in Next.js and early explorations into server-side developer tools. Improving Stability The Pages Router has been around for six years now. The release of the App Router meant the introduction of new APIs which are still young, with just six months of usage. We've come a long way in a short amount of time, but there are still opportunities to improve as we learn more from our community and how they're using it. We appreciate the community's willingness to eagerly adopt the App Router and provide feedback. There's been a number of bug reports we're investigating and we're thankful for the minimal reproductions you have created to help isolate issues and verify fixes. Since 13.4, we've already patched a number of high impact bugs around stability that are available in the latest patch release ( 13.4.7 ). We will be continuing to focus on performance and stability with high intensity. Improving Developer Education While we believe the new features of the App Router and modern React are powerful, they also require additional education and documentation to help teach these new concepts. Next.js features We've been working over the past year to re-write the Next.js documentation from scratch. This work is now live on nextjs.org/docs . We'd like to highlight some important pieces : Pages and App toggles: You can switch between learning the Pages Router or App Router documentation using the button on the left side of the documentation. Further, you can filter search results based on your router choice. Improved content and information architecture: Almost every single page of the App Router documentation has been refreshed, including more clear structure and cohesiveness between pages, and hundreds of new illustrations to visually explain how Next.js works. More to come : We have more work to do here. The Developer Experience team at Vercel is working hard to provide additional learning resources (including an updated course on /learn teaching the App Router) and real world codebase examples (including a rewrite of Next.js Commerce ). We'll be releasing new content in the documentation , on Twitter , YouTube , and more. New React features We've also heard your feedback about the education around new React features that are available in the Next.js App Router. Server Components : It's important to note that features like Server Components and conventions like the \"use client\" directive are not Next.js specific, but a larger part of the React ecosystem. Our team, our partners at Meta, and other independent contributors are working to provide more education around these topics. It's early days for these concepts, but we're confident in the React ecosystem and continued education . Client Components : With the recent conversation around Server Components, it's important to note the client components are not a de-optimization. The client is a valid part of the React model and is not going away. You can think of client components as the existing Next.js ecosystem today, where your favorite libraries and tools continue to work. For example, a common question we've seen is whether \"use client\" needs to be added to every single file to make it a client component. This is not necessary, but we understand these concepts are new and will take time to learn. You only need to mark the top level boundary where you code moves between the server to the client. This architecture allows you to interweave server and client components together . Growing third-party ecosystem : In addition to education, the ecosystem around React's newer features is still growing. For example, Panda CSS , a CSS-in-JS library from the makers of Chakra UI, just announced support for React Server Components. Server Actions (Alpha) : Server Actions enable server-side data mutations, reduced client-side JavaScript, and progressively enhanced forms. We do not recommend using Server Actions in production yet. We appreciate early feedback from alpha testers helping us shape the future of this feature. Thank you We're thankful many of you have chosen to learn and build with Next.js. Our focus on performance, stability, and developer experience will be reflected in the upcoming releases of Next.js. We want using Next.js to be delightful‚Äîand to make you (and your team) more productive. As always, we greatly appreciate your feedback. If you are experiencing any issues with Next.js, please open an issue , or start a new discussion , and we will investigate.",

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Tuesday, October 26th 2021 Next.js 12 Posted by Connor Davis @ connordav_is DongYoon Kang @ kdy1dev Gerald Monaco @ devknoll Javi Velasco @ javivelasco Jiachi Liu @ huozhi JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Kara Erickson @ karaforthewin Maia Teegarden @ padmaia Shu Ding @ shuding_ Steven @ styfle Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Tobias Koppers @ wSokra As we announced at Next.js Conf , Next.js 12 is our biggest release ever: Rust Compiler : ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds Middleware (beta) : Enabling full flexibility in Next.js with code over configuration React 18 Support : Native Next.js APIs are now supported, as well as Suspense <Image /> AVIF Support : Opt-in for 20% smaller images Bot-aware ISR Fallback : Optimized SEO for web crawlers Native ES Modules Support : Aligning with the standardized module system URL Imports (alpha) : Import packages from any URL, no installs required React Server Components (alpha) : Try it today, including SSR streaming Update today by running npm i next@latest . Faster builds and Fast Refresh with Rust compiler We want to make every Next.js application build faster for production, and get instant feedback in local development. Next.js 12 includes a brand new Rust compiler that takes advantage of native compilation. Our Rust compiler is built on SWC , an open platform for the next generation of fast tooling. We've optimized bundling and compiling with ~ 3x faster refresh locally and ~ 5x faster builds for production. Other improvements and features include: Results from using the new Rust compiler with large Next.js codebases. Further speed improvements for large codebases: We've validated the Rust compiler with some of the largest Next.js codebases in the world. Improved observability into performance: Next.js now outputs Fast Refresh timing in the console for both client and server compilation, including the number of modules and files compiled. Underlying webpack improvements: We've made numerous improvements to webpack, including optimizing Fast Refresh and making on-demand entries more reliable. Compilation using Rust is 17x faster than Babel and enabled by default using Next.js 12, replacing transforming JavaScript and TypeScript files. This meant we had to port the Babel transformations in Next.js to Rust, including a brand new CSS parser in Rust used to implement the styled-jsx transform. The new Rust compiler is backwards compatible. If you have an existing Babel configuration, you will automatically be opted out. We have plans to port parsing for popular libraries like styled-components , emotion , and relay soon. If you're using a custom Babel setup, please share your configuration . You can also opt-in to using the Rust compiler for minification. This is 7x faster than Terser . Minification is opt-in until it‚Äôs thoroughly validated as it replaces multi-year infrastructure. next.config.js module . exports = { swcMinify : true , }; On top of hiring DongYoon Kang , the creator of SWC, and Maia Teegarden , a contributor to Parcel , we are continuing to invest in the Rust ecosystem. If you have experience working with Rust, please apply to join our team . For more information, watch our demo from Next.js Conf. Introducing Middleware Middleware enables you to use code over configuration. This gives you full flexibility in Next.js because you can run code before a request is completed. Based on the user's incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, adding headers, or even streaming HTML. Middleware gives you complete flexibility inside Next.js. Middleware can be used for anything that shares logic for a set of pages, including: Authentication Bot protection Redirects Rewrites Feature flags and A/B tests Advanced i18n routing requirements And more ! Middleware uses a strict runtime that supports standard Web APIs like fetch . This works out of the box using next start , as well as on Edge platforms like Vercel, which use Edge Middleware . To use Middleware in Next.js, you can create a file pages/_middleware.js . In this example, we use the standard Web API Response ( MDN ): pages/_middleware.js export function middleware (req , ev) { return new Response ( 'Hello, world!' ); } For more information, watch our demo from Next.js Conf and check out the documentation . Preparing for React 18 React 18 will add features like Suspense, automatic batching of updates, APIs like startTransition , and a new streaming API for server rendering with support for React.lazy . We've been working closely with the React team at Facebook to prepare Next.js for React 18 as it moves towards a stable release. We're making these features available to try today in Next.js 12 under an experimental flag. Terminal npm install react@alpha react-dom@alpha Server-Side Streaming Concurrent features in React 18 include built-in support for server-side Suspense and SSR streaming support. This allows you to server-render pages using HTTP streaming. This is an experimental feature in Next.js 12, but once enabled, SSR will use the same strict runtime as Middleware. To enable, use the experimental flag concurrentFeatures: true : next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { concurrentFeatures : true , } , }; React Server Components React Server Components allow us to render everything, including the components themselves, on the server. This is fundamentally different from server-side rendering where you're pre-generating HTML on the server. With Server Components, there's zero client-side JavaScript needed , making page rendering faster. This improves the user experience of your application, pairing the best parts of server-rendering with client-side interactivity. next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { concurrentFeatures : true , serverComponents : true , } , }; Next.js now enables you to do data fetching at the component level , all expressed as JSX. By using React Server components, we can simplify things. Special functions like getServerSideProps or getStaticProps are no longer needed. This aligns with the React Hooks model of colocating data fetching with your components. You can rename any Next.js page to .server.js to create a Server Component and import client components directly inside your Server Components. These client components will hydrate and become interactive, so you add functionality like upvotes. We're currently working on server-side Suspense, selective hydration, and streaming rendering in Next.js and will share our progress in a future blog post. Special thanks to our collaborators Kara Erickson and Gerald Monaco on the Google Aurora team for their work on React 18 and Server Components. For more information, watch our demo from Next.js Conf and check out the documentation . ES Modules Support and URL Imports ES modules bring an official, standardized module system to JavaScript. They're supported by all major browsers as well as Node.js. This standard pushes the web ecosystem forward by enabling smaller package sizes and JavaScript bundles, ultimately leading to a better user experience. As the JavaScript ecosystem transitions from Common JS (the old standard) to ES modules, we're committed to helping developers incrementally adopt these improvements without unnecessary breaking changes. Starting with Next.js 11.1 , we added experimental support for ES modules being prioritized over CommonJS modules. In Next.js 12, this is now the default. Importing NPM modules that only provide CommonJS is still supported. URL Imports Next.js 12 includes experimental support for importing ES Modules through URLs, no install or separate build step is required. URL imports allow you to use any package directly through a URL. This enables Next.js to process remote HTTP(S) resources exactly like local dependencies. If a URL import is detected, Next.js will generate a next.lock file to track remote resources. URL imports are cached locally to ensure you can still work offline. Next.js supports both client and server URL imports. To opt-in, add the allowed URL prefixes inside next.config.js : next.config.js module . exports = { experimental : { urlImports : [ 'https://cdn.skypack.dev' ] , } , }; Then, you can import modules directly from URLs: import confetti from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti' ; Any CDN that serves ES modules will work, including no-code and design tools like Framer: Skypack esm.sh jsDelivr JSPM unpkg For more information, watch our demo from Next.js Conf and check out the documentation . Bot-Aware ISR Fallback Currently, Incremental Static Regeneration with fallback: true renders a fallback state before rendering the page contents on the first request to a page that was not generated yet. To block the page from loading (server-rendering), you would need to use fallback: 'blocking' . In Next.js 12, web crawlers (e.g. search bots) will automatically server-render ISR pages using fallback: true , while still serving the previous behavior of the fallback state to non-crawler User-Agents. This prevents crawlers from indexing loading states. Smaller images using AVIF The built-in Image Optimization API now supports AVIF images, enabling 20% smaller images compared to WebP. AVIF images can take longer to optimize compared to WebP, so we're making this feature opt-in using the new images.formats property in next.config.js : next.config.js module . exports = { images : { formats : [ 'image/avif' , 'image/webp' ] , } , }; This list of formats is used to determine the optimized image format on-demand using the request's Accept header. Since AVIF is first, it will be served if the browser supports AVIF . If not, WebP will be served if the browser supports WebP . If neither format is supported, the original image format will be served. Output File Tracing In Next.js 8, we introduced the target option. This allowed for outputting Next.js pages as standalone JavaScript bundles by bundling all dependencies using webpack during the build. We quickly realized this wasn't ideal and instead created @vercel/nft . @vercel/nft has been used for over 2 years on all deployments on the Vercel platform. Now, we're bringing these improvements directly into the Next.js framework by default, for all deployment platforms , providing a significantly improved approach over the target option. Next.js 12 automatically traces which files are needed by each page and API route using @vercel/nft , and outputs these trace results next to the next build output, allowing integrators to leverage the traces Next.js provides automatically. These changes also optimize applications deploying using tools like Docker through next start . By leveraging @vercel/nft , we will be able to make the Next.js output standalone in the future. No dependencies will be required to be installed to run the application, massively reducing the Docker image size. Bringing @vercel/nft into Next.js supersedes the target approach, making target deprecated in Next.js 12. Check out the documentation for more info. Other Improvements Adding pages/_app.js or pages/_document.js to your application now automatically replaces the built-in version without requiring a reboot of the Next.js CLI. The ESLint integration now supports single-file linting in next lint with the --file flag. Next.js 12 now supports setting a custom tsconfig.json path. next.config.mjs is now supported for writing the configuration as ES modules. In-flight requests are now de-duped for getStaticProps. Checking for static pages now runs using a shared worker pool. Fast Refresh now uses a WebSocket connection instead of a EventSource connection. Breaking Changes After making webpack 5 the default in Next.js 11 , we've now officially removed webpack 4. We've worked closely with the community to ensure a smooth transition to webpack 5. target in next.config.js is no longer needed. next/image now uses a span as the wrapping element instead of a div . The minimum Node.js version has been bumped from 12.0.0 to 12.22.0 , which is the first version of Node.js with native ES modules support. To learn more, check out the upgrade guide . Community Five years ago, we released Next.js to the public. We set out to build a zero-configuration React framework that simplifies your developer experience. Looking back, it's incredible to see how the community has grown, and what we've been able to ship together. Let's keep going. Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 1,800 individual developers , industry partners like Google and Facebook, and our core team.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, April 6th 2023 Next.js 13.3 Posted by Delba de Oliveira @ delba_oliveira Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Next.js 13.3 adds popular community-requested features, including: File-Based Metadata API : Dynamically generate sitemaps, robots, favicons, and more. Dynamic Open Graph Images : Generate OG images using JSX, HTML, and CSS. Static Export for App Router : Static / Single-Page Application (SPA) support for Server Components. Parallel Routes and Interception : Advanced routing features for the App Router. Update today by running: Terminal npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest We are closing in on marking App Router as stable in the next minor release and are shifting our focus to optimizing performance, enhancing behaviors, and fixing bugs. While we're still working on a few features like Mutations we don't expect these to impact the API surface of other App Router features. We're excited to see what you build with the App Router and look forward to your feedback . File-Based Metadata API In Next.js 13.2 , we announced a new Metadata API, allowing you to define metadata (e.g. title , meta , and link tags inside your HTML head element) by exporting a Metadata object from a layout or page. layout.js or page.js // either Static metadata export const metadata = { title : 'Home' , }; // Output: // <head> //\t <title>Home</title> // </head> // or Dynamic metadata export async function generateMetadata ({ params , searchParams }) { const product = await getProduct ( params .id); return { title : product .title }; } // Output: // <head> //\t <title>My Unique Product</title> // </head> export default function Page () {} In addition to config-based metadata, the Metadata API now supports new file conventions, allowing you to conveniently customize your pages for improved SEO and sharing on the web: opengraph-image.(jpg|png|svg) twitter-image.(jpg|png|svg) favicon.ico icon.(ico|jpg|png|svg) sitemap.(xml|js|jsx|ts|tsx) robots.(txt|js|jsx|ts|tsx) manifest.(json|js|jsx|ts|tsx) For example, you can use file-based metadata to add a favicon for your app and an open graph image for your /about page: app ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.js ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.js ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ about ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ opengraph-image.jpg ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.js Next.js will automatically serve these files with hashes (for the file name) in production for caching, and update the relevant head elements with the correct metadata information such as the asset's URL, file type, and image size. // Visiting \"/\" < link rel = \"icon\" href = \"<computedUrl>\" /> // Visiting \"/about\" < link rel = \"icon\" href = \"<computedUrl>\" /> < meta property = \"og:image\" content = \"<computedUrl>\" type = \"<computedType>\" ... /> Adding static files to your application is often the simplest approach, but there are cases where you may need to create files dynamically. For each static file convention, there's an accompanying dynamic (.js|.jsx|.ts|.tsx) variant that allows you to write code to generate the file. For example, while you can add a static sitemap.xml file, most sites have some pages that are dynamically generated using an external data source. To generate a dynamic sitemap, you can add a sitemap.js file that returns an array of your dynamic routes. app/sitemap.js export default async function sitemap () { const res = await fetch ( 'https://.../posts' ); const allPosts = await res .json (); const posts = allPosts .map ((post) => ({ url : `https://acme.com/blog/ ${ post .slug } ` , lastModified : post .publishedAt , })); const routes = [ '' , '/about' , '/blog' ] .map ((route) => ({ url : `https://acme.com ${ route } ` , lastModified : new Date () .toISOString () , })); return [ ... routes , ... posts]; } With config-based and new file-based options, you now have a comprehensive Metadata API to cover both static and dynamic metadata. The Metadata API is available in 13.3 for the App Router ( app ). It is not available in the pages directory. Learn more about file-based metadata and view the API reference . Dynamic Open Graph Image Generation Six months ago, we released @vercel/og and Satori , libraries that allow you to generate images dynamically using JSX, HTML, and CSS. @vercel/og was put to the test at Next.js Conf , generating over 100,000 dynamic ticket images for every attendee. With extensive adoption across Vercel customers and over 900,000 downloads since the release, we're excited to bring dynamically generated images to all Next.js applications without the need for an external package. You can now import ImageResponse from next/server to generate images: /app/about/opengraph-image.tsx import { ImageResponse } from 'next/server' ; export const size = { width : 1200 , height : 600 }; export const alt = 'About Acme' ; export const contentType = 'image/png' ; export const runtime = 'edge' ; export default function og () { return new ImageResponse (); // ... } ImageResponse naturally integrates well with other Next.js APIs, including Route Handlers and file-based Metadata. For example, you can use ImageResponse in a opengraph-image.tsx file to generate Open Graph and Twitter images at build time or dynamically at request time. Learn more about the Image Response API. Static Export for App Router The Next.js App Router now supports fully static exports. You can start as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrade to use Next.js features that require a server. When running next build , Next.js generates an HTML file per route. By breaking a strict SPA into individual HTML files, Next.js can avoid loading unnecessary JavaScript code on the client-side, reducing the bundle size and enabling faster page loads. next.config.js /** * @type {import('next').NextConfig} */ const nextConfig = { output : 'export' , }; module . exports = nextConfig; Static Export works with the app router's new features including static Route Handlers, Open Graph images, and React Server Components. For example, Server Components will run during the build, similar to traditional static-site generation, rendering the components into static HTML for the initial page load and a static payload for client navigation between routes. Previously, to use Static Export in the pages directory, you needed to run next export . However, with the next.config.js option, next build will output a out directory when output: 'export' is set. You can use the same configuration for the app router and pages directory. This means next export is no longer required. With advanced static export support, you'll get errors earlier in the development process ( next dev ), such as when attempting to use a dynamic function that requires a server like cookies() or headers() . Learn more about Static Export . Parallel Routes and Interception Next.js 13.3 introduces new dynamic conventions that allow you to implement advanced routing cases: Parallel Routes and Intercepting Routes . These features enable you to show more than one page in the same view, like with complex dashboards or modals. With Parallel Routes, you can simultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. It can also be used to conditionally render pages. Parallel Routes are created using named \"slots\". Slots are defined with the @folder convention: dashboard ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @user ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.js ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @team ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.js ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.js ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.js The layout in the same route segment accepts the slots as props: app/dashboard/layout.js export default async function Layout ({ children , user , team }) { const userType = getCurrentUserType (); return ( <> {userType === 'user' ? user : team} {children} </> ); } In the example above, the @user and @team parallel route slots (explicit) are conditionally rendered based on your logic. children is an implicit route slot that does not need to be mapped to a @folder . For example, dashboard/page.js is equivalent to dashboard/@children/page.js . Intercepting routes allow you to load a new route within the current layout while \"masking\" the browser URL. This is useful when keeping the context of the current page is important, such as expanding a photo in a feed through a modal where the feed is kept in the background of the modal. Intercepting routes can be defined with the (..) convention, similar to relative paths ../ . You can also use the (...) convention to create a path relative to the app directory. feed ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @modal ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ( .. )photo ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [id] ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx photo ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [id] ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx In the example above, clicking the photo from the user's profile will open the photo in a modal during client-side navigation. However, refreshing or sharing the page will load the photo with its default layout. Parallel routes and interception enable Instagram-like modal routing. This solves the challenges you may have when creating modals, such as making the modal content shareable through an URL, preventing context from being lost when the page is refreshed, and closing and reopening the modal with backward and forward navigation. For more examples and behavior, see the Parallel and Intercepting Routes documentation . Other Improvements Design Updates: The Next.js homepage and showcase have been refreshed with a new design. Turbopack: Added support for Middleware, all next/font options, and streaming with Server Components as it approaches beta ( see demo ). We've also patched additional bugs discovered while dogfooding on mature Next.js apps like vercel.com and nextjs.org . Learn more . Fast Refresh for next.config.js : Making changes to next.config.js will now automatically restart your local dev server. This extends automatic reloading of .env , .env.* , jsconfig.json , tsconfig.json configuration files. Accessibility: The App Router now includes the route annoucement from pages . This feature announces client-side route transitions to screen readers and other assistive technology. Learn more . Statically Typed Links : redirects and rewrites set in next.config.js are now considered during type checking. Learn more . Tailwind CSS for create-next-app : When starting a new project with npx create-next-app@latest , you can now optionally select Tailwind CSS, or use the --tailwind flag, to preconfigure your application with this styling solution. Route Handlers: Using export default instead of a supported HTTP verb now throws a helpful error with route.ts . Learn more about Route Handlers . Images: next/image now supports the fetchPriority=\"high\" attribute. Metadata: The previous API for metadata ( head.js ), which was deprecated in 13.2, has been removed. Instead, use the built-in support for SEO through the Metadata API. Opt folders out of routing: Prefix a folder with _ to opt it and any child segments out of routing. For example, app/_dashboard/page.tsx would not be routable. App Router: We've added a new useParams client component hook to read the dynamic parameters for the given route segment. Learn more . Improved Stylesheet Loading: Next.js now implements React‚Äôs Suspensey CSS which fixes many issues around CSS loading and flashes of unstyled content, particularly during navigation. Improved Not Found handling: In addition to catching expected notFound() errors, the root app/not-found.js file will also handle any unmatched URLs for your whole application. This means users that visit a URL that is not handled by your app will be shown the UI exported by the app/not-found.js file. Learn more . Improved client-side router cache: router.refresh() will now invalidate the entire cache and search params are now part of the cache key allowing navigation between two search params (e.g. /?search=leerob and /?search=tim ) to correctly restore content that relied on the param. Community Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 2,600 individual developers, industry partners like Google and Meta, and our core team at Vercel. With over 4.2 million npm downloads per week and 104,000+ GitHub stars, Next.js is one of the most popular ways of building the Web. Join the community on GitHub Discussions , Reddit , and Discord .

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Monday, March 29th 2021 Next.js 10.1 Posted by Bel√©n Curcio @ okbel JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Joe Haddad @ timer150 Lee Robinson @ leeerob Luis Alvarez @ luis_fades Shu Ding @ shuding_ Steven @ styfle Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens We are excited to introduce Next.js 10.1, featuring: 3x Faster Refresh : 200ms faster refresh with no changes necessary. Improved Installation Time : 58% smaller install size and 56% fewer dependencies. next/image Improvements : Apple Silicon (M1) Support, plus more layout and loader options. Next.js Commerce Shopify Integration : Flexible data layer for composable e-commerce apps. Custom 500 Page : Add your own logo and branding to error pages. Strict PostCSS Configuration Loading : Improved caching with Webpack 5. Support for extends in tsconfig.json : Extensible configuration for large TypeScript apps. Detect When Preview Mode Is Enabled : Conditionally show content when viewing previews. Router Methods Scroll to Top : Automatically scroll to the top, now consistent for all routing. Documentation Improvements : Incremental adoption, migration, and Docker deployment. 3x Faster Refresh Starting with v9.4 , Next.js brought Facebook's Fast Refresh into open-source for instantaneous feedback on edits made to your React components. This means Next.js only updates code in the file you edited, and only re-renders that component, without losing component state. This includes styles (inline, CSS-in-JS, or CSS/Sass Modules), markup, event handlers, and effects (via useEffect ). Today, we're making it 200ms faster on every edit without any code changes on your side . On average, this makes Fast Refresh 3x faster. Want even faster performance and better build times? Opt-in to Webpack 5 today with a new future flag.This flag is a release candidate (RC) and Webpack 5 will become the default soon. After you've enabled this flag, please share any feedback with us . next.config.js module . exports = { future : { webpack5 : true , } , }; To learn more about how Webpack 5 is being rolled out to your application in a backward-compatible way, check out the documentation . Improved Installation Time We've optimized Next.js' dependency graph to decrease install time and dependency size. It's now faster than ever to create a Next.js project, both locally and in your CI/CD process. 10.0 10.1 delta Average installation time ~15s ~5s 3.0x faster Installation size 96.5MB 39.9MB 58% smaller Number of dependencies 424 187 56% smaller As part of our goal to optimize dependencies, we also updated and/or replaced npm packages that were marked as deprecated by their authors ‚Äì even when they were deeply nested in the dependency tree. A fresh install of Next.js 10.1 will now result in no package warnings. next/image Improvements Apple Silicon Support When Next.js 10 was released, Image Optimization was powered by a native dependency. This led to a slower installation time, with native dependencies consuming 50% of Next.js' total install size.\nFurther, this removes post-install running scripts and causing on-demand compilation. We're excited to share Automatic Image Optimization through next/image is now powered by WebAssembly . This optimization works out of the box using next dev and next start .\nBy using WASM, we've reduced install size by ~30MB and added support for Apple Silicon M1 MacBooks . We're continuing to improve our WebAssembly performance by taking advantage of SIMD extensions and multi-threading. Additional Layouts Based on your feedback, we've added a variety of new layouts and options for next/image : layout=fill : You don't need to provide width and height . ( Demo ) layout=fixed : Native img behavior. ( Demo ) layout=responsive : Flexible width with fixed aspect ratio. ( Demo ) layout=intrinsic : Won't grow, but can shrink with fixed aspect ratio. ( Demo ) objectFit=cover : Background images. ( Demo ) For more information, check out the layout documentation . Improved Image Optimization Support We've expanded on the built-in image loaders for next/image with the ability to add any custom loader. By using the new loader prop, you can optimize images with any provider or CDN . components/my-image.js import Image from 'next/image' ; const myLoader = ({ src , width , quality }) => { return `https://example.com/ ${ src } ?w= ${ width } &q= ${ quality || 75 } ` ; }; const MyImage = (props) => { return ( < Image loader = {myLoader} src = \"/me.png\" alt = \"Picture of the author\" width = { 500 } height = { 500 } /> ); }; For more information, check out the next/image documentation . Next.js Commerce Shopify Integration E-commerce is one of the fastest-growing industries adopting Next.js.\nCompanies like Apple, Wal-Mart, McDonald's, and Nike trust Next.js. We wanted to give you a high-performance starting point for building e-commerce applications, so we released Next.js Commerce .\nAfter thousands of requests for Shopify, we've updated Next.js Commerce with a provider-agnostic UI ‚Äî enabling you to bring any headless e-commerce solution of your choice. Switching between providers is a single-line change in your configuration. We've also created a Features API, allowing you to toggle functionality based on your use case ‚Äì all while retaining best-in-class performance. Lighthouse metrics for Next.js Commerce around the globe. With a few clicks, Next.js developers can clone, deploy, and fully customize their own e-commerce store. Learn more at nextjs.org/commerce and try out our Shopify Demo . Support for more commerce providers is coming soon. Custom 500 Page You can now create a custom pages/500.js to add your own logo and branding when displaying errors. Similar to pages/404.js , this file is statically generated at build time. pages/500.js export default function Custom500 () { return < h1 >500 - Server-side error occurred</ h1 >; } Strict PostCSS Configuration Loading If you're using PostCSS and Webpack 5, you can improve performance (through caching) with a new future flag. next.config.js module . exports = { future : { webpack5 : true , strictPostcssConfiguration : true , } , }; Try it out today and let us know your feedback. For more information, check out the PostCSS Config documentation . Support for extends in tsconfig.json You can now use extends in the tsconfig.json used by Next.js to extend from a different tsconfig.json in your project. For example, you can extend from a tsconfig.base.json in your project as follows: tsconfig.json { \"extends\" : \"./tsconfig.base.json\" } For more information, check out the TypeScript documentation . Detect When Preview Mode Is Enabled You can now detect when Preview Mode is enabled, allowing you to render certain components only for editors. components/MyComponent.js import { useRouter } from 'next/router' ; function MyComponent () { const { isPreview } = useRouter (); return <>{isPreview ? < h1 >Preview Mode Enabled</ h1 > : null }</>; } For more information, check out the Preview Mode documentation . Router Methods Scroll to Top When navigating using next/link , Next.js will automatically scroll to the top. With Next.js 10.1 router.push and router.replace will also automatically scroll to the top to match the next/link behavior. You can opt-out of the automatic scrolling using the scroll option. For more information, check out the next/router documentation . Documentation Improvements We've also added a variety of new guides, resources, and documentation, including: Incrementally Adopting Next.js Migrating from Gatsby Migrating from Create React App Migrating from React Router Authentication Deploying with Docker Community We're excited to see the continued growth in Next.js adoption: We have had over 1,540 independent contributors, with over 240 new contributors since the 10.0 release On GitHub, the project has been starred over 64,950 times. Join the Next.js community on GitHub Discussions. Discussions is a community space that allows you to connect with other Next.js users and freely ask questions or share your work.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Wednesday, April 28th 2021 Next.js 10.2 Posted by Connor Davis @ connordav_is JJ Kasper @ _ijjk Shu Ding @ shuding_ Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens Tobias Koppers @ wSokra We are excited to introduce Next.js 10.2, featuring: Faster Builds : Up to ~60% faster subsequent builds with caching. Faster Refresh : 100ms to 200ms faster refresh. Faster Startup : Up to ~24% faster next dev . Improved Accessibility : Route changes are now announced by screen readers. More Flexible Redirects and Rewrites : Match any header, cookie, or query string. Automatic Webfont Optimization : Improved performance by inlining font CSS. Update today by running npm i next@latest . Webpack 5 With Next.js 10.1, we improved Fast Refresh and decreased installation times . We're excited to share additional performance improvements enabled through webpack 5. Today, we're expanding the rollout of webpack 5 to Next.js applications. Starting from Next.js 10.2, all applications that do not use a custom webpack configuration in their next.config.js will automatically use webpack 5. When webpack 5 is enabled, you'll automatically get new features and improvements like: Improved Disk Caching: Disk caching allows the compiler to persist work between next build runs. Only changed files will be recompiled, leading to increased performance. Vercel customer Scale observed a 63% speedup on subsequent builds. Improved Fast Refresh: Next.js now prioritizes Fast Refresh related compilation, resulting in a 100ms to 200ms faster refresh every time. Improved Long Term Caching of Assets: Output between multiple next build runs is now deterministic, improving browser caching of JavaScript assets in production. Hashes are kept the same when the content of a page does not change. Improved Tree Shaking: CommonJS modules can now be tree shaken to automatically remove unused code. Static analysis is used to determine side-effect free modules. export * tracks more information and no longer flags the default export as used. Inner-module tree-shaking is also enabled, allowing for imports that are only used in an unused export to be tree shaken. We've worked hard to ensure a smooth transition from webpack 4 to 5. The Next.js core test suite with over 3,400 integration tests runs on every pull request with webpack 5 support enabled. If your application has a custom webpack configuration, we recommend following the documentation to enable webpack 5 . After upgrading to webpack 5 in Next.js, please share any feedback with us . Improved Startup Performance We've improved the Next.js CLI initialization making boot time for next dev up to 24% faster after the first run. For example, next dev for vercel.com went from 3.3s to 2.5s. We're on a mission to make your local development experience real-time ( 20x faster ). Stay tuned for additional startup performance improvements in upcoming releases. Accessibility Improvements Route changes are now announced to screen readers and other assistive technology by default. The example below shows the heading \"Real Data. Real Performance\" being announced by macOS VoiceOver on client-side navigation. The page name is found by first looking for an <h1> element, falling back to document.title , and lastly to the pathname. Route changes are now automatically announced. Thank you to Kyle Boss and Kitty Giraudel for helping land this feature. Routing based on Headers and Query String Parameters Next.js rewrites , redirects , and headers now support a new has property allowing you to match against incoming headers, cookies, and query strings. Vercel customer Joyn uses has to optimize content for both discoverability and performance. For example, you could redirect old browsers based on the User-Agent : next.config.js module . exports = { async redirects () { return [ { source : '/:path((?!old-browser$).*)' , has : [ { type : 'header' , key : 'User-Agent' , value : 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; Microsoft; Lumia 950)' , } , ] , destination : '/old-browser' , permanent : false , } , ]; } , }; Another example could be redirecting users based on their location: next.config.js module . exports = { async redirects () { return [ { source : '/:path((?!uk/).*)' , has : [ { type : 'header' , key : 'x-vercel-ip-country' , value : 'GB' , } , ] , destination : '/uk/:path*' , permanent : true , } , ]; } , }; Finally, you could redirect if a user is already logged in: next.config.js module . exports = { async redirects () { return [ { source : '/' , has : [ { type : 'header' , key : 'x-authorized' , value : '(?<authorized>yes|true)' , } , ] , destination : '/dashboard?authorized=:authorized' , permanent : false , } , ]; } , }; To learn more and explore additional examples, check out the redirects documentation . Automatic Webfont Optimization 82% of web pages for desktop use web fonts. Custom fonts are important for the branding, design, and cross-browser/device consistency of your site. However, using a web font should not come at the cost of performance. Next.js now supports Automatic Webfont Optimization when using web fonts. By default, Next.js will automatically inline font CSS at build time, eliminating an extra round trip to fetch font declarations. This results in improvements to First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). For example: // Before < link href = \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter\" rel = \"stylesheet\" /> // After < style data-href = \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter\" > @font-face { font-family : 'Inter' ; font-style : normal ; <! -- ... -- > } </ style > Automatic Webfont Optimization currently supports Google Fonts and we're working to expand support further to other font providers. We're also planning to add control over loading strategies and font-display values. By optimizing fonts by default, we're able to help developers ship faster websites and improve their Core Web Vitals without any additional effort. Thank you our partners at Google and Janicklas Ralph for helping land this feature. Growing the Team We're excited to announce Tobias Koppers, the author of webpack , has joined the Next.js team at Vercel.

      "title": "Layouts RFC | Next.js",
      "text_content": "Back to Blog Monday, May 23rd 2022 Layouts RFC Posted by Delba de Oliveira @ delba_oliveira Lee Robinson @ leeerob Sebastian Markb√•ge @ sebmarkbage Tim Neutkens @ timneutkens This RFC (Request for Comment) outlines the biggest update to Next.js since it was introduced in 2016: Nested Layouts: Build complex applications with nested routes. Designed for Server Components: Optimized for subtree navigation. Improved Data Fetching: Fetch in layouts while avoiding waterfalls. Using React 18 Features: Streaming, Transitions, and Suspense. Client and Server Routing: Server-centric routing with SPA-like behavior. 100% incrementally adoptable : No breaking changes so you can adopt gradually. Advanced Routing Patterns : Parallel routes, intercepting routes, and more. The new Next.js router will be built on top of the recently released React 18 features. We plan to introduce defaults and conventions that allow you to easily adopt these new features and take advantage of the benefits they unlock. Work on this RFC is ongoing and we'll announce when the new features are available. To provide feedback, join the conversation on Github Discussions . Table of Contents Motivation Terminology How Routing Currently Works The app Directory Defining Routes Layouts Pages React Server Components Data Fetching Route Groups (New) Server Centric Routing (New) Instant Loading States (New) Error Handling (New) Templates (New) Advanced Routing Patterns (New) Conclusion Motivation We've been gathering community feedback from GitHub, Discord, Reddit, and our developer survey about the current limitations of routing in Next.js. We've found that: The developer experience of creating layouts can be improved. It should be easy to create layouts that can be nested, shared across routes, and have their state preserved on navigation. Many Next.js applications are dashboards or consoles, which would benefit from more advanced routing solutions. While the current routing system has worked well since the beginning of Next.js, we want to make it easier for developers to build more performant and feature-rich web applications. As framework maintainers, we also want to build a routing system that is backwards compatible and aligns with the future of React. Note: Some routing conventions were inspired by the Relay-based router at Meta, where some features of Server Components were originally developed, as well as client-side routers like React Router and Ember.js. The layout.js file convention was inspired by the work done in SvelteKit. We'd also like to thank Cassidy for opening an earlier RFC on layouts . Terminology This RFC introduces new routing conventions and syntax. The terminology is based on React and standard web platform terms. Throughout the RFC, you'll see these terms linked back to their definitions below. Tree: A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure. For example, a component\ntree with parent and children components, a folder structure, etc. Subtree Part of the tree, starting at the root (first) and ending at the leaves (last). URL Path: Part of the URL that comes after the domain. URL Segment: Part of the URL path delimited by slashes. How Routing Currently Works Today, Next.js uses the file system to map individual folders and files in the Pages directory to routes accessible through URLs. Each page file exports a React Component and has an associated route based on its file name. For example: Dynamic Routes: Next.js supports Dynamic Routes (including catch all variations) with the [param].js , [...param].js and [[...param]].js conventions. Layouts: Next.js offers support for simple component-based layouts, per-page layouts using a component property pattern , and a single global layout using a custom app . Data Fetching: Next.js provides data fetching methods ( getStaticProps , getServerSideProps ) which can be used at the page (route) level. These methods are used to determine if a page should be Statically Generated ( getStaticProps ) or Server-Side Rendered ( getServerSideProps ). In addition, you can use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to create or update static pages after a site is built. Rendering: Next.js provides three rendering options: Static Generation , Server-Side Rendering , and Client-Side Rendering . By default, pages are statically generated unless they have a blocking data fetching requirement ( getServerSideProps ). Introducing the app Directory To ensure these new improvements can be incrementally adopted and avoid breaking changes, we are proposing a new directory called app . The app directory will work alongside the pages directory. You can incrementally move parts of your application to the new app directory to take advantage of the new features. For backwards compatibility, the behavior of the pages directory will remain the same and continue to be supported. Defining Routes You can use the folder hierarchy inside app to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder. For example, you can add a new /dashboard/settings route by nesting two new folders in the app directory. Note: With this system, you'll use folders to define routes, and files to define UI (with new file conventions such as layout.js , page.js , and in the second part of the RFC loading.js ). This allows you to colocate your own project files (UI components, test files, stories, etc) inside the app directory. Currently this is only possible with the pageExtensions config . Route Segments Each folder in the subtree represents a route segment . Each route segment is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path . For example, the /dashboard/settings route is composed of 3 segments: The / root segment The dashboard segment The settings segment Note : The name route segment was chosen to match the existing terminology around URL paths . Layouts New file convention: layout.js So far, we have used folders to define the routes of our application. But empty folders do not do anything by themselves. Let's discuss how you can define the UI that will render for these routes using new file conventions. A layout is UI that is shared between route segments in a subtree . Layouts do not affect URL paths and do not re-render (React state is preserved) when a user navigates between sibling segments. A layout can be defined by default exporting a React component from a layout.js file. The component should accept a children prop which will be populated with the segments the layout is wrapping. There are 2 types of layouts: Root layout: Applies to all routes Regular layout: Applies to specific routes You can nest two or more layouts together to form nested layouts . Root Layout You can create a root layout that will apply to all routes of your application by adding a layout.js file inside the app folder. Note: The root layout replaces the need for a custom App ( _app.js ) and custom Document ( _document.js ) since it applies to all routes. You'll be able to use the root layout to customize the initial document shell (e.g. <html> and <body> tags). You'll be able to fetch data inside the root layout (and other layouts). Regular Layouts You can also create a layout that only applies to a part of your application by adding a layout.js file inside a specific folder. For example, you can create a layout.js file inside the dashboard folder which will only apply to the route segments inside dashboard . Nesting Layouts Layouts are nested by default. For example, if we were to combine the two layouts above. The root layout ( app/layout.js ) would be applied to the dashboard layout, which would also apply to all route segments inside dashboard/* . Pages New file convention: page.js A page is UI that is unique to a route segment. You can create a page by adding a page.js file inside a folder. For example, to create pages for the /dashboard/* routes, you can add a page.js file inside each folder. When a user visits /dashboard/settings , Next.js will render the page.js file for the settings folder wrapped in any layouts that exist further up the subtree . You can create a page.js file directly inside the dashboard folder to match the /dashboard route. The dashboard layout will also apply to this page: This route is composed of 2 segments: The / root segment The dashboard segment Note: For a route to be valid, it needs to have a page in its leaf segment. If it doesn't, the route will throw an error. Layout and Page Behavior The file extensions js|jsx|ts|tsx can be used for Pages and Layouts. Page Components are the default export of page.js . Layout Components are the default export of layout.js . Layout Components must accept a children prop. When a layout component is rendered, the children prop will be populated with a child layout (if it exists further down the subtree ) or a page. It may be easier to visualize it as a layout tree where the parent layout will pick the nearest child layout until it reaches a page. Example: app/layout.js // Root layout // - Applies to all routes export default function RootLayout ({ children }) { return ( < html > < body > < Header /> {children} < Footer /> </ body > </ html > ); } app/dashboard/layout.js // Regular layout // - Applies to route segments in app/ dashboard /* export default function DashboardLayout ({ children }) { return ( <> < DashboardSidebar /> {children} </> ); } app/dashboard/analytics/page.js // Page Component // - The UI for the `app/ dashboard /analytics` segment // - Matches the `acme.com/ dashboard /analytics` URL path export default function AnalyticsPage () { return < main >...</ main >; } The above combination of layouts and pages would render the following component hierarchy: Component hierarchy < RootLayout > < Header /> < DashboardLayout > < DashboardSidebar /> < AnalyticsPage > < main >...</ main > </ AnalyticsPage > </ DashboardLayout > < Footer /> </ RootLayout > React Server Components Note: React introduced new component types: Server, Client (traditional React components), and Shared. To learn more about these new types, we recommend reading the React Server Components RFC . With this RFC, you can start using React features and incrementally adopt React Server Components into your Next.js application. The internals of the new routing system will also leverage recently released React features such as Streaming, Suspense, and Transitions. These are the building blocks for React Server Components. Server Components as the Default One of the biggest changes between the pages and app directories is that, by default, files inside app will be rendered on the server as React Server Components. This will allow you to automatically adopt React Server Components when migrating from pages to app . Note: Server components can be used in the app folder or your own folders, but cannot be used in the pages directory for backwards compatibility. Client and Server Components Convention The app folder will support server, client, and shared components, and you'll be able to interleave these components in a tree . There is an ongoing discussion on what exactly the convention will be for defining Client Components and Server Components. We will follow the resolution of this discussion. For now, Server components can be defined by appending .server.js to the filename. E.g. layout.server.js Client components can be defined by appending the .client.js to the filename. E.g. page.client.js . .js files are considered shared components. Since they could be rendered on the Server and the Client, they need to respect the constraints of each context. Note: Client and Server components have constraints that need to be respected. When deciding to use a client or server component, we recommend using server components (default) until you need to use a client component. Hooks We'll be adding Client and Server component hooks that‚Äôll allow you to access the headers object, cookies, pathnames, search params, etc. In the future, we'll have documentation with more information. Rendering Environments You'll have granular control of what components will be in the client-side JavaScript bundle using the Client and Server Components convention. By default, routes in app will use Static Generation, and will switch to dynamic rendering when a route segment uses server-side hooks that require request context. Interleaving Client and Server Components in a Route In React, there's a restriction around importing Server Components inside Client Components because Server Components might have server-only code (e.g. database or filesystem utilities). For example, importing the Server Component would not work: ClientComponent.js import ServerComponent from './ServerComponent.js' ; export default function ClientComponent () { return ( <> < ServerComponent /> </> ); } However, a Server Component can be passed as a child of a Client Component. You can do this by wrapping them in another Server Component. For example: ClientComponent.js export default function ClientComponent ({ children }) { return ( <> < h1 >Client Component</ h1 > {children} </> ); } // ServerComponent.js export default function ServerComponent () { return ( <> < h1 >Server Component</ h1 > </> ); } // page.js // It's possible to import Client and Server components inside Server Components // because this component is rendered on the server import ClientComponent from \"./ClientComponent.js\" ; import ServerComponent from \"./ServerComponent.js\" ; export default function ServerComponentPage () { return ( <> < ClientComponent > < ServerComponent /> </ ClientComponent > </> ); } With this pattern, React will know it needs to render ServerComponent on the server before sending the result (which doesn't contain any server-only code) to the client. From the Client Component's perspective, its child will be already rendered. In layouts, this pattern is applied with the children prop so you don't have to create an additional wrapper component. For example, the ClientLayout component will accept the ServerPage component as its child: app/dashboard/layout.js // The Dashboard Layout is a Client Component export default function ClientLayout ({ children }) { // Can use useState / useEffect here return ( <> < h1 >Layout</ h1 > {children} </> ); } // The Page is a Server Component that will be passed to Dashboard Layout // app/ dashboard /settings/page.js export default function ServerPage () { return ( <> < h1 >Page</ h1 > </> ); } Note: This style of composition is an important pattern for rendering Server Components inside Client Components. It sets the precedence of one pattern to learn, and is one of the reasons why we've decided to use the children prop. Data fetching It will be possible to fetch data inside multiple segments in a route. This is different from the pages directory, where data fetching was limited to the page-level. Data fetching in Layouts You can fetch data in a layout.js file by using the Next.js data fetching methods getStaticProps or getServerSideProps . For example, a blog layout could use getStaticProps to fetch categories from a CMS, which can be used to populate a sidebar component: app/blog/layout.js export async function getStaticProps () { const categories = await getCategoriesFromCMS (); return { props : { categories } , }; } export default function BlogLayout ({ categories , children }) { return ( <> < BlogSidebar categories = {categories} /> {children} </> ); } Multiple data fetching methods in a route You can also fetch data in multiple segments of a route. For example, a layout that fetches data can also wrap a page that fetches its own data. Using the blog example above, a single post page can use getStaticProps and getStaticPaths to fetch post data from a CMS: app/blog/[slug]/page.js export async function getStaticPaths () { const posts = await getPostSlugsFromCMS (); return { paths : posts .map ((post) => ({ params : { slug : post .slug } , })) , }; } export async function getStaticProps ({ params }) { const post = await getPostFromCMS ( params .slug); return { props : { post } , }; } export default function BlogPostPage ({ post }) { return < Post post = {post} />; } Since both app/blog/layout.js and app/blog/[slug]/page.js use getStaticProps , Next.js will statically generate the whole /blog/[slug] route as React Server Components at build time - resulting in less client-side JavaScript and faster hydration. Statically generated routes improve this further, as the client navigation reuses the cache (Server Components data) and doesn't recompute work, leading to less CPU time because you're rendering a snapshot of the Server Components. Behavior and priority Next.js Data Fetching Methods ( getServerSideProps and getStaticProps ) can only be used in Server Components in the app folder. Different data fetching methods in segments across a single route affect each other. Using getServerSideProps in one segment will affect getStaticProps in other segments. Since a request already has to go to a server for the getServerSideProps segment, the server will also render any getStaticProps segments. It will reuse the props fetched at build time so the data will still be static, the rendering happens on-demand on every request with the props generated during next build . Using getStaticProps with revalidate (ISR) in one segment will affect getStaticProps with revalidate in other segments. If there are two revalidate periods in one route, the shorter revalidation will take precedence. Note: In the future, this may be optimized to allow for full data fetching granularity in a route. Data fetching with React Server Components The combination of Server-Side Routing, React Server Components, Suspense and Streaming have a few implications for data fetching and rendering in Next.js: Parallel data fetching Next.js will eagerly initiate data fetches in parallel to minimize waterfalls. For example, if data fetching was sequential , each nested segment in the route couldn't start fetching data until the previous segment was completed. With parallel fetching, however, each segment can eagerly start data fetching at the same time. Since rendering may depend on Context, rendering for each segment will start once its data has been fetched and its parent has finished rendering. In the future, with Suspense, rendering could also start immediately - even if the data is not completely loaded. If the data is read before it's available, Suspense will be triggered. React will start rendering Server Components optimistically, before the requests have completed, and will slot in the result as the requests resolve. Partial Fetching and Rendering When navigating between sibling route segments, Next.js will only fetch and render from that segment down. It will not need to re-fetch or re-render anything above. This means in a page that shares a layout, the layout will be preserved when a user navigates between sibling pages, and Next.js will only fetch and render from that segment down. This is especially useful for React Server Components, as otherwise each navigation would cause the full page to re-render on the server instead of rendering only the changed part of the page on the server. This reduces the amount of data transfered and execution time, leading to improved performance. For example, if the user navigates between the /analytics and the /settings pages, React will re-render the page segments but preserve the layouts: Note: It will be possible to force a re-fetch of data higher up the tree . We are still discussing the details of how this will look and will update the RFC. Route Groups The hierarchy of the app folder maps directly to URL paths. But it‚Äôs possible to break out of this pattern by creating a route group. Route groups can be used to: Organize routes without affecting the URL structure. Opt a route segment out of a layout. Create multiple root layouts by splitting the application. Convention A route group can be created by wrapping a folder‚Äôs name in parenthesis: (folderName) Note: The naming of route groups are only for organizational purposes since they do not affect the URL path. Example: Opting a route out of a layout To opt a route out of a layout, create a new route group (e.g. (shop) ) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. account and cart ). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. checkout ). Before: After: Example: Organizing routes without affecting the URL path Similarly, to organize routes, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. (marketing) or (shop) ). Example: Creating multiple root layouts To create multiple root layouts, create two or more route groups at the top level of the app directory. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The <html> , <body> and <head> tags of each root layout can be customized separately. Server-Centric Routing Currently, Next.js uses client-side routing. After the initial load and on subsequent navigation, a request is made to the server for the resources of the new page. This includes the JavaScript for every component (including components only shown under certain conditions) and their props (JSON data from getServerSideProps or getStaticProps ). Once both the JavaScript and data are loaded from the server, React renders the components client-side. In this new model, Next.js will use server-centric routing while maintaining client-side transitions. This aligns with¬†Server Components¬†which are evaluated on the server. On navigation, data is fetched and React renders the components server-side . The output from the server are special instructions (not HTML or JSON) for React on the client to update the DOM. These instructions hold the result of the rendered Server Components meaning that no JavaScript for that component has to be loaded in the browser to render the result. This is in contrast to the current default of Client components, which the component JavaScript to the browser to be rendered client-side. Some benefits of server-centric routing with React Server Components include: Routing uses the same request used for Server Components (no additional server requests are made). Less work is done on the server because navigating between routes only fetches and renders the segments that change. No additional JavaScript is loaded in the browser when client-side navigating when no new client components are used. The router leverages a new streaming protocol so that rendering can start before all data is loaded. As users navigate around an app, the router will store the result of the React Server Component payload in an in-memory client-side cache. The cache is split by route segments which allows invalidation at any level and ensures consistency across concurrent renders. This means that for certain cases, the cache of a previously fetched segment can be re-used. Note Static Generation and Server-side caching can be used to optimize data fetching. The information above describes the behavior of subsequent navigations. The initial load is a different process involving Server Side Rendering to generate HTML. While client-side routing has worked well for Next.js, it scales poorly when the number of potential routes is large because the client has to download a route map. Overall, by using React Server Components, client-side navigation is faster because we load and render less components in the browser. Instant Loading States With server-side routing, navigation happens after data fetching and rendering so it‚Äôs important to show loading UI while the data is being fetched otherwise the application will seem unresponsive. The new router will use Suspense for instant loading states and default skeletons. This means loading UI can be shown immediately while the content for the new segment loads. The new content is then swapped in once rendering on the server is complete. While rendering is happening: Navigation to the new route will be immediate. Shared layouts will remain interactive while new route segments load. Navigation will be interruptible - meaning the user can navigate between routes while the content of one route is loading. Default loading skeletons Suspense boundaries will be automatically handled behind-the-scenes with a new file convention called loading.js . Example: You will be able to create a default loading skeleton by adding a loading.js file inside a folder. The loading.js should export a React component: loading.js export default function Loading () { return < YourSkeleton /> } // layout.js export default function Layout ({children}) { return ( <> < Sidebar /> {children} </> ) } // Output <> < Sidebar /> < Suspense fallback = {< Loading />}>{children}</ Suspense > </> This will cause all segments in the folder to be wrapped in a suspense boundary. The default skeleton will be used when the layout is first loaded and when navigating between sibling pages. Error Handling Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree. Convention You'll be able to create an Error Boundary that will catch errors within a subtree by adding a error.js file and default exporting a React Component. The Component will be shown as a fallback if an error is thrown within that subtree. This component can be used to log errors, display useful information about the error, and functionality to attempt to recover from the error. Due to the nested nature of segments and layouts, creating Error boundaries allows you to isolate errors to those parts of the UI. During an error, layouts above the boundary will remain interactive and their state will be preserved. error.js export default function Error ({ error , reset }) { return ( <> An error occurred: { error .message} < button onClick = {() => reset ()}>Try again</ button > </> ); } // layout.js export default function Layout ({children}) { return ( <> < Sidebar /> {children} </> ) } // Output <> < Sidebar /> < ErrorBoundary fallback = {< Error />}>{children}</ ErrorBoundary > </> Note: Errors inside a layout.js file in the same segment as an error.js will not be caught as the automatic error boundary wraps the children of a layout and not the layout itself. Templates Templates are similar to Layouts in that they wrap each child Layout or Page. Unlike Layouts that persist across routes and maintain state, templates create a new instance for each of their children. This means that when a user navigates between route segments that share a template, a new instance of the component is mounted. Note: We recommend using Layouts unless you have a specific reason to use a Template. Convention A template can be defined by exporting a default React component from a template.js file. The component should accept a children prop which will be populated with nested segments. Example template.js export default function Template ({ children }) { return < Container >{children}</ Container >; } The rendered output of a route segment with a Layout and a Template will be as such: < Layout > { /* Note that the template is given a unique key. */ } < Template key = {routeParam}>{children}</ Template > </ Layout > Behavior There may be cases where you need to mount and unmount shared UI, and templates would be a more suitable option. For example: Enter/exit animations using CSS or animation libraries Features that rely on useEffect (e.g logging page views) and useState (e.g a per-page feedback form) To change the default framework behavior. E.g. suspense boundaries inside Layouts only show the fallback the first time the Layout is loaded and not when switching pages. For templates, the fallback is shown on each navigation. For example, consider the design of a nested layout with a bordered container that should be wrapped around every sub-page. You could put the container inside the parent layout ( shop/layout.js ): shop/layout.js export default function Layout ({ children }) { return < div className = \"container\" >{children}</ div >; } // shop/page.js export default function Page () { return < div >...</ div >; } // shop/categories/layout.js export default function CategoryLayout ({ children }) { return < div >{children}</ div >; } But any enter/exit animations wouldn‚Äôt play when switching pages because the shared parent layout doesn‚Äôt re-render. You could put the container in every nested layout or page: shop/layout.js export default function Layout ({ children }) { return < div >{children}</ div >; } // shop/page.js export default function Page () { return < div className = \"container\" >...</ div >; } // shop/categories/layout.js export default function CategoryLayout ({ children }) { return < div className = \"container\" >{children}</ div >; } But then you‚Äôd have to manually put it in every nested layout or page which can be tedious and error-prone in more complex apps. With this convention, you can share templates across routes that create a new instance on navigation. This means DOM elements will be recreated, state will not be preserved, and effects will be re-synchronized. Advanced Routing Patterns We plan to introduce conventions to cover edge cases and allow you to implement more advanced routing patterns. Below are some examples we have been actively thinking about: Intercepting Routes Sometimes, it may be useful to intercept route segments from within other routes. On navigation, the URL will be updated as normal, but the intercepted segment will be shown within the current route‚Äôs layout. Example Before: Clicking the image leads to a new route with its own layout. After: By intercepting the route, clicking the image now loads the segment within the current route‚Äôs layout. E.g. as a modal. To intercept the /photo/[id] route from within /[username] segment, create a duplicate /photo/[id] folder inside the /[username] folder, and prefix it with the (..) convention. Convention (..) - will match the route segment one level higher (sibling of the parent directory). Similar to ../ in relative paths. (..)(..) - will match the route segment two levels higher. Similar to ../../ in relative paths. (...) - will match the route segment in the root directory. Note: Refreshing or sharing the page would load the route with its default layout. Dynamic Parallel Routes Sometimes it may be useful to show two or more leaf segments ( page.js ) in the same view that can be navigated independently. Take for instance two or more tab groups within the same dashboard. Navigating one tab group should not affect the other. The combinations of tabs should also be correctly restored when navigating backwards and forwards. Convention By default, layouts accept a prop called children which will contain a nested layout or a page. You can rename the prop by creating a named \"slot\" (a folder that includes the @ prefix) and nesting segments inside it. After this change, the layout will receive a prop called customProp instead of children . analytics/layout.js export default function Layout ({ customProp }) { return <>{customProp}</>; } You can create parallel routes by adding more than one named slot at the same level. In the example below, both @views and @audience are passed as props to the analytics layout. You can use the named slots to display leaf segments simultaneously. analytics/layout.js export default function Layout ({ views , audience }) { return ( <> < div > < ViewsNav /> {views} </ div > < div > < AudienceNav /> {audience} </ div > </> ); } When the user first navigates to /analytics , the page.js segment in each folder ( @views and @audience ) are shown. On navigation to /analytics/subscribers , only @audience is updated. Similarly, only @views are updated when navigating to /analytics/impressions . Navigating backwards and forwards will reinstate the correct combination of parallel routes. Combining Intercepting and Parallel Routes You can combine intercepting and parallel routes to achieve specific routing behaviors in your application. Example For example, when creating a modal, you often need to be aware of some common challenges, such as: Modals not being accessible through an URL. Modals closing when the page is refreshed. Backwards navigation going to the previous route rather than the route behind the modal. Forwards navigation not reopening the modal. You may want the modal to update the URL when it opens, and backwards/fowards navigation to open and close the modal. Additionally, when sharing the URL, you may want the page to load with the modal open and context behind it or you may want the page to load the content without the modal. A good example of this are photos on social media sites. Usually, photos are accessible within a modal from the user's feed or profile. But when sharing the photo, they shown directly on their own page. By using conventions, we can make the modal behavior map to routing behavior by default. Consider this folder structure: With this pattern: The content of /photo/[id] is accessible through an URL within its own context. It's also accessible within a modal from within the /[username] route. Navigating backwards and forwards using client-side navigation should close and reopen the modal. Refreshing the page (server-side navigation) should take the user to the original /photo/id route instead of showing the modal. In /@modal/(..)photo/[id]/page.js , you can return the content of the page wrapped in a modal component. /@modal/(..)photo/[id]/page.js export default function PhotoPage () { const router = useRouter (); return ( < Modal // the modal should always be shown on page load isOpen = { true } // closing the modal should take user back to the previous page onClose = {() => router .back ()} > { /* Page Content */ } </ Modal > ); } Note: This solution isn't the only way to create a modal in Next.js, but aims to show how you can combine conventions to achieve more complex routing behavior. Conditional Routes Sometimes, you may need dynamic information like data or context to determine what route to show. You can use parallel routes to conditionally load one route or another. Example layout.js export async function getServerSideProps ({ params }) { const { accountType } = await fetchAccount ( params .slug); return { props : { isUser : accountType === 'user' } }; } export default function UserOrTeamLayout ({ isUser , user , team }) { return <>{isUser ? user : team}</>; } In the example above, you can return either the user or team route depending on the slug. This allows you to conditionally load the data and match the sub-routes against one option or the other. Conclusion We're excited about the future of layouts, routing, and React 18 in Next.js. Implementation work has begun and we'll announce the features once they are available. Leave comments and join the conversation on GitHub Discussions .",

Improved Performance : Further optimizations to improve cold startup time so you can start coding faster. next/script : Automatically prioritize loading of third-party scripts to improve performance. next/image : Reduce layout shift and create a smoother visual experience with automatic size detection and support for blur-up placeholders. Webpack 5 : Now enabled by default for all Next.js applications, bringing these benefits to all Next.js developers. Create React App Migration (Experimental) : Automatically convert Create React App to be Next.js compatible. Next.js Live (Preview Release) : Code in the browser, with your team, in real time. Update today by running npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest and reference the migration guide below. Conformance Even with great tools and automatic optimizations in frameworks, site owners and app developers are often asked to become experts in UX quality topics, like performance, security, and accessibility. As features are added and teams scale, developers need to think differently. Through their work building large-scale web applications like Search and Maps, Google has proven that frameworks can play a crucial role in maintaining quality as teams and applications scale. By leveraging a system of strong defaults and safeguards, they empower developers to focus more on features and products. Today, Google's Web Platforms team has begun open-sourcing their system with Conformance for Next.js . Conformance is a system that provides carefully crafted solutions and rules to support optimal loading and Core Web Vitals, with further additions coming to support other quality aspects like security and accessibility. These solutions free your team from memorizing all the latest rules for optimal loading performance, while still giving you the flexibility to make the right choices for your applications. Along with many foundational optimizations backed by performance research, Next.js 11 now supports ESLint out of the box to make it easier to catch framework-specific issues during development and set guidelines for your team to ensure best practices even as you scale. To get started with ESLint, run npx next lint after upgrading to Next.js 11. The ESLint integration works for new and existing Next.js applications, providing a new set of rules to help developers build better applications. $ npx next lint\nWe created the .eslintrc file for you and included the base Next.js ESLint configuration.\n\n./pages/about.js\n7:9  Warning: Do not include stylesheets manually.

Improved Performance Since Next.js 10, we've been obsessed with further improving the developer experience of Next.js. In 10.1 and 10.2 we improved startup time by up to 24% and shaved off another 40% of processing time for changes through React Fast Refresh. You've been getting these amazing speed improvements just by keeping Next.js updated. Next.js 11 includes another optimization to Babel to further reduce the startup time. We've created a brand new implementation of the Babel loader for webpack, optimizing loading and adding an in-memory config caching layer. In practice, this means no change for developers but will ultimately mean a faster development experience. Script Optimization The new Next.js Script Component is a foundational optimization that enables developers to set the loading priority of third-party scripts to save developer time and improve loading performance. Websites often need third parties for things like analytics, ads, customer support widgets, and consent management. However, these scripts tend to be heavy on loading performance and can drag down the user experience. Developers often struggle to decide where to place them in an application for optimal loading. With next/script , you can define the strategy property and Next.js will automatically prioritize them to improve loading performance: beforeInteractive : For critical scripts that need to be fetched and executed before the page is interactive, such as bot detection and consent management. These scripts are injected into the initial HTML from the server and run before self-bundled JavaScript is executed. afterInteractive ( default ): For scripts that can fetch and execute after the page is interactive, such as tag managers and analytics. These scripts are injected on the client-side and will run after hydration. lazyOnload For scripts that can wait to load during idle time, such as chat support and social media widgets. < Script src = {url} strategy = \"beforeInteractive\" // lazyOnload, afterInteractive /> You can also run code after loading. For example, you can wait to execute code until after a user has answered consent: < Script src = {url} // consent mangagement strategy = \"beforeInteractive\" onLoad = {() => { // If loaded successfully, then you can load other scripts in sequence }} /> We've also changed the default script loading experience in Next.js 11 from preloading and async to defer . Third-party scripts often compete with higher priority resources, such as CSS, fonts, and images. Maintaining the proper sequencing relative to these resources, as well as other scripts, is an undue burden on developers. By providing a Script Component with a default loading strategy of afterInteractive , developers now have better defaults for optimal performance, with the ability to still choose beforeInteractive as needed. To learn more about the technical choices behind switching the default, check out the RFC and challenges with preload from the Google Chrome team. Image Improvements We're excited to share two of our community's top requested features for the next/image component, reducing Cumulative Layout Shift and creating a smoother visual experience. Automatic Size Detection (Local Images) Use the import keyword for the image src to automatically define width and height for static images. For example, using the built-in Image component is now even easier: pages/index.js import Image from 'next/image' ; import author from '../public/me.png' ; export default function Home () { return ( // When importing the image as the source, you // don't need to define `width` and `height`. < Image src = {author} alt = \"Picture of the author\" /> ); } Image Placeholders next/image now supports blur-up placeholders to ease the transition from blank space to image and reduce perceived loading time, particularly for users with slower internet connections. To use blurred placeholders, add placeholder=\"blur\" to your image. < Image src = {author} alt = \"Picture of the author\" placeholder = \"blur\" /> Next.js also supports blurring dynamic images by allowing you to provide a custom blurDataURL , which is provided by your backend. For example, you can generate a blurha.sh on the server. < Image src = \"https://nextjs.org/static/images/learn.png\" blurDataURL = \"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAhEAACAQMDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAUGIWEREiMxUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEgMRkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AltJagyeH0AthI5xdrLcNM91BF5pX2HaH9bcfaSXWGaRmknyJckliyjqTzSlT54b6bk+h0R//2Q==\" alt = \"Picture of the author\" placeholder = \"blur\" /> Webpack 5 With Next.js 10.2, we expanded the rollout of webpack 5 to all applications without a custom webpack configuration in their next.config.js . Today, we're making webpack 5 the default for all Next.js applications , which will provide a variety of features and improvements . We've worked closely with the community to ensure a smooth transition to webpack 5, over 3,400 existing Next.js integration tests run on every pull request with webpack 5 enabled. If your application has a custom webpack configuration, we recommend following the upgrade documentation for webpack 5 . If you run into any issues, please share feedback with us . CRA Migration Over the past six months, we've seen an increase in applications migrating from Create React App to Next.js to leverage many of the developer experience and end-user performance improvements Next.js provides. To help developers convert their applications to Next.js, we've introduced a new tool to @next/codemod that automatically converts Create React App applications to be Next.js compatible. The transform automatically adds a pages/ directory and moves CSS imports to the right location. It'll also enable a Create React App compatibility mode in Next.js that ensures some patterns used in Create React App work with Next.js. By leveraging the new transform, you can incrementally adopt Next.js while maintaining the functionality of the existing Create React App application. To get started migrating your Create React App project use the following command: Terminal npx @next/codemod cra-to-next This feature is currently experimental, please share any feedback in this discussion . Next.js Live (Preview Release) Next.js Live is a continuation of our mission to make development not only faster and more enjoyable, but crucially more inclusive of the entire organization . By leveraging cutting-edge technology like ServiceWorker, WebAssembly, and ES Modules, Next.js Live puts the entire development process in the web browser. This opens up possibilities like collaborating and sharing instantaneously with a URL, without a build step . For developers, this means a faster feedback loop, less time waiting for builds, and real-time peer programming and editing within the browser. To learn more about Next.js Live and how you can pair it with Vercel's real-time collaboration engine, see the Next.js Live section of the documentation. Upgrade Guide Next.js 11 introduces a few breaking changes which should not affect the majority of users. These legacy features have been maintained in a backward-compatible way for years, some as far back as v4.0 . These features were removed to decrease the bundle size and ensure the codebase is maintainable for the future. To learn more about upgrading from version 10 to 11, please see the upgrade guide . With Next.js 11, the minimum React version has been updated to 17.0.2 . Please see the React 17 blog post for more details. We are also working closely with the React team as they introduce React 18 . Next.js 11 uses createRoot when React 18 alpha is being used. Community Next.js is the result of the combined work of over 1,600 individual developers, industry partners like Google and Facebook, and our core team.

      "text_content": "Back to Blog Thursday, January 18th 2024 Next.js 14.1 Posted by Jiachi Liu @ huozhi Jimmy Lai @ feedthejim Next.js 14.1 includes developer experience improvements including: Improved Self-Hosting: New documentation and custom cache handler Turbopack Improvements: 5,600 tests passing for next dev --turbo DX Improvements: Improved error messages, pushState and replaceState support Parallel & Intercepted Routes: 20 bug fixes based on your feedback next/image Improvements: <picture> , art direction, and dark mode support Upgrade today or get started with: Terminal npx create-next-app@latest Improved Self-Hosting We've heard your feedback for improved clarity on how to self-host Next.js with a Node.js server, Docker container, or static export. We've overhauled our self-hosting documentation on: Runtime environment variables Custom cache configuration for ISR Custom image optimization Middleware With Next.js 14.1, we've also stabilized providing custom cache handlers for Incremental Static Regeneration and the more granular Data Cache for the App Router: next.config.js module . exports = { cacheHandler : require .resolve ( './cache-handler.js' ) , cacheMaxMemorySize : 0 , // disable default in-memory caching }; Using this configuration when self-hosting is important when using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, where each pod will have a copy of the cache. Using a custom cache handler will allow you to ensure consistency across all pods hosting your Next.js application. For instance, you can save the cached values anywhere, like Redis or Memcached. We'd like to thank @neshca for their Redis cache handler adapter and example. Turbopack Improvements We're continuing to focus on the reliability and performance of local Next.js development: Reliability: Turbopack passing the entire Next.js development test suite and dogfooding Vercel's applications Performance: Improving Turbopack initial compile times and Fast Refresh times Memory Usage: Improving Turbopack memory usage We plan to stabilize next dev --turbo in an upcoming release with it still being opt-in. Reliability Next.js with Turbopack now passes 5,600 development tests (94%) , 600 more since the last update. You can follow the progress on areweturboyet.com . We have continued dogfooding next dev --turbo on all Vercel's Next.js applications, including vercel.com and v0.dev . All engineers working on these applications are using Turbopack daily. We've found and fixed a number of issues for very large Next.js applications using Turbopack. For these fixes, we've added new tests to the existing development test suites in Next.js. Performance For vercel.com , a large Next.js application, we've seen: Up to 76.7% faster local server startup Up to 96.3% faster code updates with Fast Refresh Up to 45.8% faster initial route compile without caching (Turbopack does not have disk caching yet) In v0.dev , we identified an opportunity to optimize the way React Client Components are discovered and bundled in Turbopack - resulting in up to 61.5% faster initial compile time. This performance improvement was also observed in vercel.com . Future Improvements Turbopack currently has in-memory caching, which improves incremental compilation times for Fast Refresh. However, the cache is currently not preserved when restarting the Next.js development server. The next big step for Turbopack performance is disk caching , which will allow the cache to be preserved when restating the development server. Developer Experience Improvements Improved Error Messages and Fast Refresh We know how critical clear error messages are to your local development experience. We've made a number of fixes to improve the quality of stack traces and error messages you see when running next dev . Errors that previously displayed bundler errors like webpack-internal now properly display the source code of the error and the affected file. After seeing an error in a client component, and then fixing the error in your editor, the Fast Refresh did not clear the error screen. It required a hard reload. We've fixed a number of these instances. For example, trying to export metadata from a Client Component. For example, this was a previous error message: An example of an error from a fetch call in Next.js 14. Next.js 14.1 has improved this to: Errors from fetch calls during rendering now display the source code of the error and the affected file. window.history.pushState and window.history.replaceState The App Router now allows the usage of the native pushState and replaceState methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page. pushState and replaceState calls integrate into the Next.js App Router, allowing you to sync with usePathname and useSearchParams . This is helpful when needing to immediately update the URL when saving state like filters, sort order, or other information desired to persist across reloads. 'use client' ; import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation' ; export default function SortProducts () { const searchParams = useSearchParams (); function updateSorting (sortOrder : string ) { const params = new URLSearchParams ( searchParams .toString ()); params .set ( 'sort' , sortOrder); window . history .pushState ( null , '' , `? ${ params .toString () } ` ); } return ( <> < button onClick = {() => updateSorting ( 'asc' )}>Sort Ascending</ button > < button onClick = {() => updateSorting ( 'desc' )}>Sort Descending</ button > </> ); } Learn more about using the native History API with Next.js. Data Cache Logging For improved observability of your cached data in your Next.js application when running next dev , we've made a number of improvements to the logging configuration option . You can now display whether there was a cache HIT or SKIP and the full URL requested: Terminal GET / 200 in 48ms ‚úì Compiled /fetch-cache in 117ms GET /fetch-cache 200 in 165ms ‚îÇ GET https://api.vercel.app/products/ 1 200 in 14ms (cache: HIT ) ‚úì Compiled /fetch-no-store in 150ms GET /fetch-no-store 200 in 548ms ‚îÇ GET https://api.vercel.app/products/ 1 200 in 345ms (cache: SKIP ) ‚îÇ ‚îÇ Cache missed reason: (cache: no-store ) This can be enabled through next.config.js : next.config.js module . exports = { logging : { fetches : { fullUrl : true , } , } , }; next/image support for <picture> and Art Direction The Next.js Image component now supports more advanced use cases through getImageProps() (stable) which don't require using <Image> directly. This includes: Working with background-image or image-set Working with canvas context.drawImage() or new Image() Working with <picture> media queries to implement Art Direction or Light/Dark Mode images import { getImageProps } from 'next/image' ; export default function Page () { const common = { alt : 'Hero' , width : 800 , height : 400 }; const { props: { srcSet: dark } , } = getImageProps ({ ... common , src : '/dark.png' }); const { props: { srcSet: light , ... rest } , } = getImageProps ({ ... common , src : '/light.png' }); return ( < picture > < source media = \"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcSet = {dark} /> < source media = \"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcSet = {light} /> < img { ... rest} /> </ picture > ); } Learn more about getImageProps() . Parallel & Intercepted Routes In Next.js 14.1, we've made 20 improvements to Parallel & Intercepted Routes. For the past two releases, we've been focused on improving performance and reliability of Next.js. We've now been able to make many improvements to Parallel & Intercepted Routes based on your feedback. Notably, we've added support for catch-all routes and Server Actions. Parallel Routes allow you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages in the same layout. For highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites, Parallel Routes can be used to implement complex routing patterns. Intercepted Routes allow you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. For example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the /photo/123 route, masks the URL, and overlays it over /feed . Learn more about Parallel & Intercepted Routes or view an example . Other Improvements Since 14.0 , we've fixed a number of highly upvoted bugs from the community. We've also recently published videos explaining caching and some common mistakes with the App Router that you might find helpful.
